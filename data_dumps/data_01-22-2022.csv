So if the first transaction performs an action that can only be done once, any subsequent transaction attempting to do the same thing will fail.     

This is why there is a slippage percentage when you buy a token, it translates to “how many other transactions are you willing to let pass before yours” (sort of).

As to how the order is decided, this is the job of the block builder, which in many cases is the miner, and many times within the block builder logic is basically a sorted order of the highest gas bidder.",1642894752.0,1

I'll copy and paste a reply I wrote over in /r/Hedera regarding Hedera's overall business model (and roadmap, I guess), just cos ain't nobody got time rewriting. Last couple paragraphs are the relevant bit but the rest is context.

""Many enterprises prefer a private dag network at the core of their infrastructure and for areas where they simply do not need public consensus.

These are designed to be modular and interoperable - this is more akin to tradition databases but built on the same kind of technology. 

IBM offer a whole suite of modular services for enterprise use in this area, with Walmart and Land Rover being some of the notable users. 

Hashgraph is designed to interoperate with these networks seamlessly providing public consensus or other specific functions if needed. 

The information is immutably encoded with no single point of failure, this remains very valuable - the private networks are more databases where Hashgraph helps create the internet out of them and allows parties that wish to do so interact directly with each other's databases with absolute trust.

In order to achieve this, Hedera offer the HCS - the simple and seamless capability of using the consensus service and nothing else. This isn't limited to private networks, anyone can use it if they so desire, as long as they pay their fees. 

This is useful for many Hyperledger clients, and you'll notice a significant overlap when comparing them with Hedera ecosystem partners (Walmart are heavily involved in promoting a new universal standard for digital coupons built entirely on Hedera's Hashgraph for example)

They also offer the HTS - programmable tokens at the native layer with all the performance on offer from the Hashgraph Algorithm (these offer about 80% of the functionality of Smart Contracts according to Mance - the rest can obviously be covered by the EVM and competing projects - if needed they can absolutely develop a superior smart contract platform but Hyperledger is already taking a good part towards this so mutual value is found.

The idea of modular, interoperable, open source infrastructure building up web 3.0 is the whole idea. You don't achieve that when one project wins alone, Hedera nonetheless offers value to the other parties within the ecosystem - that's what we're all about right? Cut out inefficiency and utilise the value gained. Just maths.

This brings me to the Hedera Smart Contract Service 

Hedera themselves aim to fully integrate Hyperledger Besu, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in the coming weeks - allowing Ethereum based dApps to run within Hedera and interact seamlessly with the Hedera ecosystem.  

Once complete, all the Ethereum developers have to do is copy and paste their code into the virtual machine and suddenly their dApp is running perfectly yet with the ~300 TPS of Besu. Kind of a no brainer as we wait for Ethereum 2.0 - and once that is in place the EVM will be able to at least keep up with the open source product, and likely continue to outpace it in the long term.",1642685654.0,1

A good chunk of those 2 billion Hedera mainnet transactions come from a single client - AdsDax - many more much larger clients will be coming online this year though. 

You're likely to use them regularly without knowing a thing - for example eftpos are using Hedera for Australia's debit system so everyone I know is going to use the network every day as I take a cut of their (tiny) network fees. ServiceNow are used by 80% of the Fortune 500 - they are integrating Hedera into their services and even offering DLT integration as a service themselves. Boeing are supposedly using it now in their design process.

Just wanna add that the EVM being integrated into Hedera's native layer means all the benefits like fixed fees and shared functionality are rolled in.



Ethereum has been the focus on development because it's been the most stable platform - yet It will literally be far better to run Eth dApps on Hedera and incredibly easy with no real risk. Just an absolutely brilliant touch as far as I'm concerned and emblematic of the intelligence of their approach across the board.

Not a fan of Layer Twos personally, particularly because I haven't seen any marked advantages over a Hashgraph's native layer that doesn't come with a significant compromise. 

I understand you can make up for the compromise elsewhere but surely you understand why this becomes less and less tenable compared to a layer one solution which apparently achieves optimal performance from a mathematical standpoint in terms of security, throughput, and efficiency, without an apparent compromise.

Maybe quantum computing shakes things up, maybe something else does. Layer 2s are less speculative than that but speculative nonetheless 

I'm certainly open to any criticism because honestly the value proposition I see makes me feel crazy. There's room for other players than Hedera, and other DLTs than Hashgraph. Yet the opportunity to me is unparalleled.",1642689975.0,1
18,CryptoTechnology,An Interesting Development with Hedera - Hashgraph Patent to be made Open Source,Vandeleur1,1642613930.0,33,59,0.87,"Regarding fees I made a reply to someone the other day, keep in mind that once again this applies to Hedera (though Hashgraph has the same underlying capability to fix fees in a scalable networks):

""Enterprise use demands stability in price - you need to write up a budget including operating costs so that you can see whether engaging in that activity is viable for your business. You simply cannot do that with variable gas fees, certainly not those of Ethereum-  and even Polygon's offering has been demonstrated to be a long way off with even a relatively small transaction volume. 

Why would an enterprise adopt and use a product that can suddenly increase 100x in cost without warning? Let alone one that can double.

Furthermore, HBAR fees may be fixed but the council can adjust them as they see fit. 

For example, minting an NFT costs $1. Avery Dennison plan to tokenize trillions of products, DLA Piper started out looking at tokenizing real-estate, now their plans go much further than even that. Obviously the adjustability of fees go both ways, I'm not hinging my argument on this particular revenue stream, the point is there's a lot you've missed, including other transaction types with their own associated fees.

Right now, for cryptocurrency transactions the price is fixed at (I think) 0.0001 USD. This is useful in its own right because it allows micropayment based usecases - a market which is completely inconceivable to you right now.

This is adequate at the moment as it incentives adoption and creates new possibilities. 

Right now the plan is to fund node operators through the treasury in the short term, if the current fees prove to be untenable past that stage, they will be changed. Adequately incentivising node operators to secure the network is an integral part of the design.

If, in the future, it is deemed that this particular type of transaction should cost more (or less) then this can be done. 

If the USD falls out of favour, they can find something else to peg it to.

If the miners turn out to be right and DLT is really just about paying a lot of money to miners and hodlers, then they can ramp the fees right up if they so desire.

My point is that this control Hedera have is a unique strength - you might disagree with how they've utilised it (I trust them and their partners a hell of a lot more than a random redditor), but nonetheless, the competing options are simply inferior and nothing else. 

They cannot be controlled or fixed because the gas demands are driven by fundamental limitations in the architecture of the other networks. Hedera's architecture is better. That's why they are being adopted""

>The set of shards can be arbitrarily sized, enabling massive parallelization of the consensus process. Notably, this form of parallelization introduces a tunable tradeoff between security and scalability: reducing the number of shards each node covers increases parallelism and scale, but decreases the validator set size of a given shard. This capability allows the system designer to select a minimum threshold of per-shard node coverage that achieves high practical security, while maximizing parallelism and scale by allowing a large number of independent nodes. This is unique to Cerberus and discussed further in the analysis section.

So they can *kinda* place the tradeoff however they want with the way their sharding design works.  But the way they frame it here is the misleading part, and where it reveals that Radix doesn't really solve any new problems because they don't do anything to decrease the overall load of fully verifying the ledger, so sacrificing decentralization as the network utilization increases and compromising its resistance to validator corruption by forcing reliance on third parties.",1642614801.0,1

These are incorrect - processing is also extremely parallel and only happens on the shards related to a transaction.

The Cerberus Infographic series is a great resource that digs into the mechanisms behind Cerberus cross shard consensus and the role the Radix Engine plays to abstract away dealing w/ sharded data from dApps and the developer.

[https://www.radixdlt.com/post/cerberus-infographic-series-chapter-vi](https://www.radixdlt.com/post/cerberus-infographic-series-chapter-vi)

The following are excerpts from Chapters 12 and 13. (It may be easier to open up the pdf versions to find text easily).

&#x200B;

>***Chapter 12 selections - on parallel transactions across shards***  
>  
>Moreover, one of the key concepts that allows this to happen is that of parallel processing. In a future where Radix has scaled to fulfill the DeFi needs of billions of people, the vast majority of transactions will involve completely unrelated substates, shards, and validator sets. Those transactions will be processed entirely in parallel across the vastness of the shardspace without ever being “aware” that the other transactions exist.  
>  
>But not everything can be processed in parallel. There must still be some logic that tells Cerberus when substates are related and must be composed in the same transaction.  
>  
>***Chapter 13 selections - on partial ordering***  
>  
>Therefore ideally, you have a network that’s intelligent enough to only order when it’s absolutely necessary, so that it can process as many transactions as possible in parallel. We therefore want a network that has “partial ordering”  
>  
>....  
>  
>For Radix, that layer of logic is the Radix Engine. It tells Cerberus which substates are related and must be ordered, and which ones are not related and do not need to be ordered and can thus be safely parallelized.  
>  
>So how does the Radix Engine do this?  
>  
>When a transaction is created, it must follow rules stipulated by the Radix Engine. Those rules stipulate that only required substates are used in a transaction, and that when new substates are created, that those are broken down into as many substates as possible, that still make logical sense  
>  
>....  
>  
>Because of the Radix Engine, nodes therefore only need to undertake consensus on the absolutely most minimal set of shards required.  
>  
>If events are not related, they just get processed in parallel, across the entire shardspace, which is so large in size as to be practically infinite.",1642658915.0,5

is people spending large quantities of money* for tokens which represent an image and do little else, a trend which will die out shortly? Hopefully.   

I don't see what problem you think NFTs for music is supposed to solve? You talk about removing middlemen, but NFTs don't seem to provide anything for that that just, letting people buy the song online using a cryptocurrency, doesn't already provide.  

If you think that they could help with DRM for audio in a way that isn't feasible for DRM for images on account of images being screenshot-able, you should know that the same can be done with audio (might be slightly more difficult, but cannot be really protected against.).  

(Also, DRM on music is against freedom)  

I of course agree that being able to more easily create/handle tokens that represent individual intangible things can be useful.

edit: also, if scalability issues are solved (or possibly using a permissioned chain with a large number of known entities, who could be held accountable for any behavior contrary to what the protocol dictates?) then the idea (which some are already pursuing) of using tokens to track what resources went into making products, in order to be assured about where the materials came from, and where the labor and other steps were done, when a manufacturing process involves materials being bought and sold between many companies. Like e.g. where did the oil come from to make this plastic? where was the plastic made? where was the plastic made into parts of shoes? The shoe company presumably doesn't process the oil into plastic themselves, nor the other materials.
Of course, these assurances would only be as trustworthy as those who made them, at least this would make it so they can be tracked. Like, if you are making a cake to sell, you can't generate yourself the assurance that the eggs were from a farm with humanely raised chickens without inventing a made-up farm entity to sign those, which people wouldn't recognize as an existing farm. An actual farm might claim to raise their chickens humanely but not actually do so, and this wouldn't solve that problem, but there are other solutions for that part. This still helps avoid the issue of the cake-maker making up the info about the source of the eggs though. (Because, the problem of checking if a farm exists is even more solved than checking if the farm raises their chickens humanely.)

Another use could be getting certifications that various steps in the process didn't emit large amounts of CO2, or something. Would need certification organizations for that, but still.)",1642553882.0,5

To mint an NFT opensea charges 2.5% of final price , same with rarity and in case of nifty is 5% and 50cents on every secondary sale, This may sound a lot but the thing is that all this gas fee should be there to incentivize the miners, without which all this would never happen.

 Also more users might/might not decrease the gas fee as this would lead to congestion and hence higher the gas fee faster will your nft be minted.

The main way that I have thought about NFTs being useful would be in a subscription/membership based model. Like for example if an exclusive restaurant issued X amount of NFTs that indicated that you held a reoccurring reservation, or just that you were allowed to eat at that particular restaurant. This NFT now not only holds value for the owner of it, but also for the restaurant.

The restaurant would gain an initial investment, and the customer now has an asset that will hopefully appreciate if the restaurant does well. Now if it does appreciate, then the customer could sell the NFT for a profit, the restaurant could then make X percentage on the resale, and would now have record of who the person sold to. This would obviously be a permission based blockchain.

I think that NFTs in particular could be useful for something like this because if it’s a smaller, permission blockchain then it would be easier to track sale and re-sale history. It would also just streamline some processes (re-sale, commission collection, knowing who holds what NFT) that could otherwise be a nuisance, or simply not cost efficient. They could also have an NFT verification system at the restaurant to prevent any forgery. There are definitely other ways to do this outside of just NFTs but this has been the primary way that I see NFTs actually having utility.

Ethereum is like a general purpose decentralised computer where you have a lot of freedom with what you can build on top of it and pay for computation time whether it succeeds or not. Tokens and non-fungible tokens are simply a code standard.

Algorand utilize the account model like Ether. The account model works by removing tokens from one account and adding it to another account in a transaction causing the state of all involved accounts to be a part of the transaction. Instead of being general purpose, it is developed for financial assets and has native support for it. This simplifies some things like asset transfers, has some benefits like fixed cost, and comes with a lot of features and configurability for assets making it suitable for regulated assets.

Cardano use an UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output) model, similar to Bitcoin, instead of an account model. To send a transaction you spend tokens as inputs and create new UTxOs. One address can have several UTxOs so instead of a global state of accounts you have to validate for a transaction, you simply spend a token as an input and create a UTxO belonging to a different address. Cardano doesn't offer feature rich assets like Algorand or decentralised computing like Ethereum but you can accomplish some of the same things by making a Script/UTxO that holds an NFT or Token instead of an account holding it directly.

It is, however, still possible to do addition without making use of this hardware (although this would be a nutty idea).

There are two levels of safeguards. The first is in L2 itself, depending on the L2 technology itself and how it's configured, there are generally rules about what you can and can't do and you will be punished if you do not follow them. This ""punishment"" step is often handled by the L1, and this is the second layer of safeguard. For example, if you are transferring coins through some lightning nodes and one lightning node doesn't transfer the coins as promise, a lightning node can take that info to the L1 chain and say ""hey, look, they promised they'd transfer the coins and they didn't!"" and L1 chain will force the transfer or revert the transfer or whatever the rules require. In short, L2 provides transaction capacity while relying on L1 only for enforcing rules when something goes wrong.

For optimistic rollups, the safeguard is that participants who verify the transactions and submit fraud proofs in case of any fraudulent activity.

For ZK rollups, the layer 1 smart contract verifies that the zero knowledge proofs submitted by the layer 2 operators are valid.

\>  What if an L2 operator pushes an update that sends 10% of every transaction to their own wallet

Transactions have to be signed by the sender, otherwise they are invalid. For zk rollups, this means that an operator trying to insert fraudulent transactions will submit an invalid zero knowledge proof that will be rejected by the layer 1 smart contract. For optimistic rollups, this means that a participant who detects the fraud can submit a fraud proof and be rewarded for it while the malicious operator is penalized.

Opening up new revenue streams via resale commission. But the offering for buyers/collectors hasn’t been particularly great. I personally am not interested in the whole “buy to get access to our private discord” - and it looks like being part of an exclusive online club doesn’t seem to be enough now. The issues with theft and rip offs are a real bummer but this happens today in the art world. It’s just that with the blockchain everyone can see how much was stolen and what was used to rip people off. 

The more interesting applications do intrigue me though, as NFTs are proof of ownership having utility in the real world could add real value. Redeemable events, conferences and concerts, access to restaurants and physical goods all exist in the NFT world today. I’m curious how this will pan out. 

In video games the idea of NFTs gets met with a huge amount of hate - not just dismissal. Sure companies need to buy in and invest time to use the blockchain data in their products. But let’s not use the argument of “buy x here use it there”.  Today if you purchase a digital good today it’s account bound. You can sell your account but that’s against TOS in most cases and it’s an all or nothing affair. The company owns your account and can revoke access at any time. Some companies allow you to resell digital goods, but only through their storefront and limited to other users who don’t already have the item. Blockchain would allow you to send, sell or burn on any store that uses that blockchain (or send off chain). If your account gets banned or stolen, your purchases are in your wallet and you can take them with you. Again, it’s the ownership that’s important not the uniqueness in this scenario. 

Then there’s interesting applications in the digital publisher world. If you purchased game licenses as NFTs and could use them at any digital store, and buy or resell through them. The store takes a cut to make some money, the publishers get commission and you actually own the game license. But that’s all pipe dream stuff and not likely. An interesting thought experiment. 

Something to remember when people call NFTs worthless is that they are literally tokens similar to any other crypto based token. The main different with ERC-20 and ERC-721 is that ERC-721 has a unique id and metadata. It’s just that 1 ETH = 1 ETH but 1NFT ≠ 1 NFT. If you agree that ERC-20 tokens have value, given that NFTs are a type of token, then they must have value in both scenarios. It’s just that the demand is a lot lower on one side of the fence, right? And rightly so - most owners want to flip and make money and nothing else. 

It’s worth noting that the metadata can be changed (that’s how NFTs reveal) and that they normally link to IPFS, a web api or URL to pull back the digital item. So the image, sound clip, video, digital selling point of an NFT can go offline in some cases. Then what value does it hold? It’s quite a compelling argument against them if the thing you bought for can disappear, but to each their own.",1642347523.0,2

This is not true if NFT dApp uses IPFS for artworks storage, as IPFS is an example of a content-addressable storage technology (the address of a file is only its hash).

The hash of the file on IPFS works differently than checksum. For example, it is not enough to make a very small change to the image, such as changing a single pixel.

The intention of IPFS designers was to protect data against deliberate (editing of a photo, changing a word in the text) altering the data, and not changing it as a result of accident.

First: speculative assets just about always experience price volatility, often because of expected future adoption. This is the way humans behave, and it is rational in this specific way, even though it seems irrational at arms-length. Because this is the way people behave, it should be expected. 

Second: some real artists have made real NFT art. Kevin Abosch is a widely well-regarded artist (one among many), and he has programmed the creation of NFTs as art. Art collectors would say that has value in the art marketplace. 

Third: if you’ve been in crypto for a while, you must know it works exactly this way. ICOs start making money, then you start seeing billions of new ICOs, most of which are absolutely ridiculous. New joke tokens start seeing their tokens boom, then we start seeing more and more joke tokens. 

Fourth: crypto is irrational as part of its ethos. Have you actually talked to people in the crypto space? They make zero sense most of the time, and that is perfect in its own way. Why? Because crypto has always been about doing something so different and so disruptive—so non-sensical—that regular people would finally have a chance at participating in global markets. We don’t trust intellect or reason or people in this context; instead, we trust the technology. The nature of blockchain is that we do not trust any particular individual; instead, we trust the community which sustains the interest in (and maintenance of) the blockchain. 

It is, in a way, a rebellion. All of these sensible, intelligent economic systems have left people feeling as if they are poor and without viable options. If NFTs also leave people poor and without options, well, at least it was done by choice. (“You think I’m stupid and what I’m doing is stupid?

might not be an accurate parallel, but I can't see myself ever being interested in buying/ selling fancy watches. It just doesn't appeal to me whatsoever. But there's a large enough cohort that buys into expensive watch collecting, and there are enough buyers and sellers.

I can see NFT art (not speaking about its other uses per se, as I have zero experience with the tech's underpinnings even if I think it's highly likely it'll be used in other ways in the future from smart people who find practical uses for it) having enough players who have dumped big money into it, who understand who's who in the scene, and are able to agree upon worth – even if others can't see it – to keep it afloat.

Who knows, though. But the NFT art doesn't seem at all about practicality or functionality, but about cultural cache. A ""Veblen good,"" in that it's about flexing to those who also flex in the same way to the in-group you wanna flex to.",1642358259.0,3

1) (optional) have the contract which tracks who owns how many of each type of card, allow a feature where you can freeze your ability to transfer the cards for a fixed amount of time  
2) at the start of the match, player’s decks are registered (possibly using some stuff to commit to them without revealing the content of one’s deck to the other player, but still granting them an assurance that one has the tokens for all the cards in one’s deck)  
3) pass back and forth signed messages describing moves and gamestate (and timestamps), in ways that are verifiably valid given the previous state. In order to handle the hidden information of “what cards are in your hand”, use the same techniques which have been used for preventing cheating in [online poker without a central server] .  
4) If any player makes an invalid move, the other player can prove this fact and win (presenting the proof to the smart contract), tell them to make a valid move, or, if they choose, allow the invalid move (if more than 2 players, or if someone other than these two players has an interest in the game, then all players, or a representative for all interested parties, must sign the same message agreeing to accept the invalid move as valid. Alternatively, committing to this not being a possibility can probably be done by using some kind of proof aggregation thing in order to be able to succinctly prove to the contract at the end that all the moves made were valid.)  
5) If a player doesn’t make a move within  a given time limit, then the next player can submit a dispute claim to the smart contract, either where this would count as the other player forfeiting, or skipping their turn, and where the player skipped has a given amount of time during which they can contest this.  
If the player making the claim had previously signed a move which came after the move they claimed wasn’t being made, they are cheating and they lose.  

There is a substantial issue here, where by refusing to make a move, (or, by refusing to send one’s opponent the message describing one’s move), one could force the other player to make their moves on-chain, as you say, which would be problematic.

(Of course, wouldn’t need the entire game state or move description, just a commitment, but still)  

6) finally, final move is verified as valid by the contract (or, if this would be computationally expensive, committed on the smart contract with a claimed result, and only verified by the contract if the claimed result is contested.)

__________

However, a much simpler solution, would be to not even have a smart contract have any transactions during a match at all, where except when cards are being traded/sold/issued/banned/unbanned , the clients simply, check the state of the smart contract, without any transaction happening.  

(Why do you want to be able to cryptographically validate all the moves of a game with a changing card list? That is very complicated with not much benefit.)  

If you want to have betting on the results of the match, just use a 3rd party judge (or panel of judges, depending on the importance of the match).

I don’t think there’s much tendency for judges to cheat or be bribed in big card game tournaments.

And, if there is a standard simulator which encodes the rules of the game, it becomes fairly unambiguous whether a ruling is legitimate. A rules judge who was bribed would lose all reputation as a rules judge.",1642372165.0,1

The current BTC hashrate is ~200 EH/s, so a 51% attack would need ~100 EH/s (100x10^18 H/s).

The Antminer S19 does about 100 TH/s (100x10^12 H/s), so you'd need around a million of them.

In practice that's way more than actually exist, but it's just a thought experiment.

It's a 3kW unit, so each one consumes 24x3 = 72kWh per day.

The cheapest electricity in the US is around 7c per kWh, so at that rate, you'd spend 72x0.07x10^6 = $5.02M / day to maintain a 51% attack.

Of course, that ignores the hardware costs. The retail cost per unit is $11,500, so the hardware alone would be north of $11.5B.

Edit: I just realized that technically it wouldn't be enough to have half the *existing* hashrate, you'd need to *match* the existing hashrate for a 51% attack, so you can double all those figures, and it would be more like $23B upfront + $10M/day.",1642350989.0,15

And possibly emotions of community and identity. Many people still can’t grasp it because they didn’t experience it yet.

I think NFTs are the evolution and combination of meme coins and DeFi. Less abstract, more approachable and more appealing than traditional crypto. I got a free LOOKS drop based on my NFT trading, that is currently staked at 800% APR.

Why would a company bother with that? If a game is networked, it still probably needs servers running to control things, since you can't just trust clients. A more decentralized setup that allows self-hosted or private server managed games with smaller groups is feasible, but then you've still got hosts with control. A p2p setup is possible, but then we're getting into a really limited set of games and a lot more complexity for the net code of a game. If you have your own servers to power the networked aspects of a game, then why not have them vend such data as well?

The reality is that reading data from the blockchain directly is pretty difficult today without running a node on the network.

A potentially better way to achieve similar results to what you described would be for a company to have a fully public dataset available at all times. A simple readonly API for it works just fine. If the company servers ever shut off, the community can fork the last state from it and let that be the source of truth. Different clients can all individually fork off on their own as well.

False. Understanding what makes proof of work the single known way to distribute control without central permission takes people a while. Proof of stake has been around and recognized to be an irrelevant fallacy for most of decade, at least in technically literate circles.

Sustainability of completely permissioned centralized systems doesn't really matter if a permissioned centralized system isn't your goal, and if it is we already had much more efficient systems for achieving that for decades.

Also very few seem to grasp the incentives at play in Proof of Work systems which goes far beyond just hash power.

It's incredibly obvious that proof of stake requires permission of previous stake owner to gain any access to control since tokens have owners and stake owners are literally rewarded for withholding control forever. Needing central permission to control is central control. Not only can proof of stake not be ever classified as decentralized, it's literally incentivizing continuous centralization of control.

Proof of work relies on permissionless external resources (matter/energy) for this reason with unforgeably continuous costs for all making it necessary to give up control to break even. It managed to do something completely unprecedented and unique - to prove something was done in outside world on-chain. There is nothing like it.

This is not the case, proof-of-stake coins are inflationary meaning they print coins each block, in many coins, being a large staker means your coins only keep pace with increasing supply (assuming total value of the coin's market stays the same). Staking rewards are generally linear and proportional to the amount of coin you have, so you don't automatically have all wealth converging into a couple of large addresses.

I see it as AR more than VR. 

Imagine adding ambiance/decorations to a restaurant through AR glasses. 

Imagine Pokemon Go but even more immersive. You can have subsets of people walking around interacting with the Pokemon Go universe, where they see Pokemon around them to catch, while another subset of people are tuned into the Avengers, Harry Potter, or LotR metaverse, with whatever that entails. It’d be like LARPing but to the extreme.

Imagine coming home and your entire house is decorated with NFTs: if you want to rearrange things for decor, instead of having to physically move things, you can just move them virtually. You could have a pet dragon, fountains of lava, unicorns, mermaids, and whatever else you want in your home.

In all these interactions, the physical world would still be present, but you are augmenting what’s already there with things that are only possibly virtually. You can even tie NFTs to physical objects. So, for example, you could have a wand that’s just some stick object in the real world, but because you own the NFT for that wand, you can use that stick in the real world to cast spells in the metaverse.

I don’t know if this vision will ever come to pass, but that’s how I can see the metaverse having the most tangible success, rather than some VR game everyone’s playing.",1642103603.0,28

Yes !!

I'm a long time gamer, started with Pokemon Yellow and up to today's games. I've always been a fan not only of playing but of the whole video game culture and the progression of game play along the years.

I was able to try out a VR game about a year ago, and while I thought it would be boring and not so revolutionary, I was hooked up as soon as I entered the tutorial.

So far I didn't dive deep into it because it's not really my cup of tea, but I was really amazed by the possibilities with a technology and games that are still young in my opinion. The immersion was great and to me it's one of the most important part for many games that are supposed to put you in a character shoes or that let you dive in a specific universe.

 So I want to try it out and I want to follow how things will evolve around that, and I think that great things will be possible, despite the fact that it'll probably won't be used the way it's supposed to be (like how social networks are bringing up so many opportunities but are used in a way that's useless and annoying for most).

GTA, Assassin's Creed, C.O.D and many gen games all need a metaverse where players can interact. where crypto and finances go is more towards RP/MMO style games. there was this one game that was very popular called imvu. it actually had its own metaverse and interactions to buy real clothes or furniture brands but to style your in game avi and rooms. 

i believe that as we go forward with communication and social experiences more apps and sites withove towards the RP style interfaces. i can definitely see Instagram doing this. there are many light weight apps and games that can implement a full metaverse/market system that works for the masses. 

you could go on and on with different use cases and reasons/ideas for metaverses but it all boils down to the original meaning and social interaction. there is this ome show called ""westworld"" thats based on a metaverse type. it's probably actually somewhere in the works as we speak. but that would be large scale.

It’s hard to say in exactly what timeframe it will be considered the new normal but we are slowly underway to making it apart of all our lives.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m a big fan of nature, the outdoors, and doing physical stuff. But the metaverse will unlock the door to doing so many fun and exciting things from the comfort of your home.

Like, travel the world, see the inside of volcanos, skydive, walk on the ledge of sky-high buildings, talk to people all over the world, and just experience things that aren’t easily accessible in life.

We all don’t even have an idea of everything VR is capable of but to say the least, history classes will be able to virtually show their students exactly what the books are talking about, gloves and probably full body suits will be developed to feel things in VR -perhaps even taste things.

Of course, it’s going to be big for gamers but eventually, a lot of us will be going to work in the metaverse. So many people are already working from home. The transition is slowly happening.

# Social interaction

Online gaming is fun for the social interactions, not the P2E hype nor game genres. Social media & media conferencing is good (if anonymousity mantained) & bad (if IRL identity locked on). Why? Me personally more readily open up myself in anonymous & make friends in like, than being around bunches of elderly that always raise issue of respect & so called ""more wise & experiences"" in life (Hence the death of FB). We trancended the era of respect based on age, race, geographical boundaries, social rank; into respect based on open wisdom & ideologies.

# Administration

Regulations is important in any interaction platforms. However, I trust consistent regulation by artificial intelligence more than by human gut feeling. Guess this blockchain not entirely trustless. AI is emotionless (sin-less), almost to the level of gods. Yes, technology improve interconnectivity like shopping & services, but the administration rules (by single authority) the one that most people complain. Also, platform administration exposure to the users also allows more tolerance & understanding why certain platform actions are taken, instead of shear blame of greed or irresponsibility.

# Others factors

I don't understand the need for VR (some people have 3D sickness) & NFT (abstract artistic value that only the crazy rich can apprehend & accept) too. In game items trading might increase game interactivity, but I understand no further than that. For example, minecraft players can play anonymously (though certain regulation by AI is needed) for social & trading for some in game item might solve scam issue, but everything else is clueless to me.",1642309223.0,1

464,CryptoTechnology,Do you genuinely want to use the metaverse?,wballard8,1642102601.0,341,124,0.93,"Never said it should. It should cost as much as people are willing to pay and sell them for. The costs of NFTs currently are outrageous and unrealistic. Current costs are not what a healthy metaverse would look like. Maybe for collector’s items. But who knows. They’ll cost whatever people are willing to buy and sell em for.

For example, if you have an NFT for a wand in the Harry Potter metaverse that allows you to perform certain very powerful spells, and there are only a few copies of that wand in existence, then it makes sense that it would cost a lot. Now, if that same wand existed in another metaverse and did the exact same things but was abundant, people could switch to that metaverse instead and capitalism would take over from there to determine the optimal price. It all depends on how well developed the metaverse is and how much people are willing to spend for a product in one metaverse environment as opposed to another. 

I’d be willing to bet people would spend a lot more for a powerful wand in the official Harry Potter metaverse than for that same wand in a random no-name metaverse. But if that random no-name metaverse has good developers that create a fun, desirable environment, then that wand could then increase in price.

I’m assuming here that there will be multiple metaverses because I find it hard to believe that there will be one metaverse with a monopoly on the entire space, though that’s entirely possible (could see an Apple vs Android metaverse type of thing happening). If there were to be one main metaverse though, you can bet your ass that any items that are scarce will be expensive as hell. 

I imagine there might be one main metaverse platform that will prevail over others, as it has the best design / SDK, and the majority of developers will choose to develop using their platform, similar to Apple with iPhones. Then other competitor metaverse platforms will try to compete and will be around but won’t be as prevalent as the main one for whatever reason (like Android / Windows phones).",1642115034.0,2

IMHO AR is much closer to the next technological leap to gain mass adoption (stable images visible in all lighting conditions) than VR (an untethered headset that’s lightweight and doesn’t cause eye strain/nausea).
In the short term it is more likely that AR will gain broader adoption (esp. with Apple Glasses, Meta’s partnership with Ray Ban, Snap Spectacles, etc.) while VR continues to evolve in its own niche (gaming, entertainment, perhaps some engineering).

Your brain has to counteract this excess dopamine and it does so by creating periods of artificial suffering to reach homeostasis again. 

In my eyes this seems like creating a life that’s quite unfulfilling, but one that seems cool in theory. You can essentially make everything exactly the way you want with little to no struggle. Seems like a front to capture and hold attention, but ends up killing productivity and fulfillment as a result.

Slightly harder to not realize that one isn’t following when reading than when watching.  

The important thing is doing. 

Get an interpreter or compiler installed and working, and get a very simple program to run (this may be copied and pasted, though it may be better to type it in yourself), and then come up with the simplest change you can think of to what you want it to do, that you think you can make, and make that change.
(I imagine you’ve progressed past “Hello, World.”, but if you were at that stage, a decent first thing to try would be “Hello, Wokeman1.”)

 If it doesn’t work, great! You need to be used to that experience. Figure out why.  
If you get an error message you don’t understand, look it up. 
(Though, before you look it up, read it. I mean, if it is many lines long, you don’t need to read the whole thing, but like, you wouldn’t paste the whole thing into google either.). 

Fix the error.
Get it working.  
Make other changes, of increasing difficulty, which require gradually more understanding.

(Fix the errors you encounter each time.
“There are two alternating steps in programming, adding bugs, and removing them.”)

Ask yourself what you can do with the things you’ve understood so far.  
What would be something neat you could do? What can you do with what you’ve learned so far that is potentially surprising that you can do it with that?
What’s something you aren’t quite sure how to accomplish, but you feel like you’re close to being able to?  
What’s the part that’s missing? Break it down.  
Look it up.  

You don’t need to learn all the language features right away, but you should be on the lookout for language features that you aren’t experienced with yet, and which would make things easier/cleaner (or make things possible).  

If it feels like there should be a way to do something, and it would be useful to you, look it up, see if there is a way.

It reminds me of another crazy idea though: create a ledger for debts and let the community build various coexisting gift economy systems on top.

1. The ledger only stores debts between accounts. Zero is the default, `2^64-1` is the maximum.
2. Two accounts can together agree to change the balance between them however they want.
3. Transactions form something like a DAG. Everything is voluntary, so there's little need for the ledger to actually reach consensus. Let other layers worry about it.

Such a system would have no speculative value and would not work as a value transfer mechanism by itself because anyone can create two accounts and set balance between them to `2^64-1`.

However it may work as a mechanism for scaling real world trust, similar to [Hawala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawala) and other [informal value transfer systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_value_transfer_system).

If Alice and Bob have a relationship and Bob and Charlie have a relationship but Alice and Charlie don't want a relationship, then Bob can be an intermediary when Alice wants to sell something to Charlie. Charlie declares debt to Bob, Bob declares debt to Alice, Alice hands over the goods off-chain.

The same process can be automated for chains of any length. The only requirement is that an escrow hands over Alice's goods to Charlie at the same time Charlie confirms the chain trade.

TL;DR: automate debt accounting in a decentralized way. No enforcement, just accounting. Intuitively it feels like something that has no reason not to work.",1642102177.0,1

Say that one week there's a few strains, and the only difference between them is the transaction fee that goes to the miner/staker. One strain is set at 0, one at some other value, and one at a massively high other value. The producers will choose not to support the 0-payout strain, so it'll die. And on the other hand, the consumers won't choose the massively high fee strain, so it'll die. Eventually, consensus will settle on a fair price for the transaction... but even if a consumer for some reason decided to pay the higher price (maybe in exchange for a expected faster transfer?), then that would still get put on the common ledger, just with a different set of rules applied (higher fee being the different rule). Another strain might support some kind of new technology, but might also incur some additional fee. A strain like this might stay around for a long time, being used by people interested in the new tech who want to pay the fee, but ignored by people who aren't interested in using that tech. Either way, all transfers get written to the same master ledger.

&#x200B;

Well I think there's a few reasons.

A) It helps to quickly achieve a viable compromise because there's new forks being made all the time and old ones getting destroyed.

B) It unites these chains into one chain with variable, simultaneous rules. There's no need to pick between btc or ltc in the long term, because you just have coin and choose which rules you want to follow for each exchange. Your coin is immortal, even if the rules that were in governance when you bought it are no longer around.

C) It prevents the exact thing you bring up. Having old tech like btc and classic eth hanging around crowds the space, and puts money in inferior technology. In an ecosystem like the one I propose, a coin like btc would probably have died off a long time ago - only to be replaced with something much better for the producers and consumers. More people get to use better technology, which leads to faster adoption.

D) This produces rule governance like 3rd gen coins always try to achieve, but without actual voting or governance. Even coins like btc, eth, ada still have hard fast rules and ""commands handed down from above"" that neither the producer nor the consumer have any influence over. By distributing power to those who use it, the people who use it can mold the product to fit their interests. The same is true for producers (miners/stakers) who now have some influence over their own life. Agency produces action. Here, the consumer and producer are both given agency and opportunity to shape their own future. And even better, the two are forced to compromise towards a solution which works for both of them.",1642081685.0,-1

This goes against what a blockchain, let alone network is used for.

Programs want just enough data so they can do the computation themselves- not doing computation all the time on the network. Crypto does this because of the protocol which encrypts everything before going on chain.

The premise is that content creators can post content and set a price in FileCoins. The media is encrypted prior to posting to IPFS. Consumers would need to pay for an unlock key. The unlock keys are based on the consumer's public key, therefore can't be shared or reused by others. Now for the ""mining"" part. When someone downloads the content, they are getting it from IPFS, a distributed network of storage providers (seeds). When someone pays for the unlock code, the network scans to see who is seeding the file and gives half the rewards to them and half to the content creator. So, if you want the content for ""free"", you need to seed it to many others. The seeding part is optional, it is a cost in storage and bandwidth to the user. 

Users can also seed other content that they never intend to unlock just to earn FileCoin in order to unlock a file of their choice at a later date. It's also similar to the model of BAT. In BAT, you watch ads to earn BAT then you later spend BAT to view premium content.

As for protections, I think the only thing FileCoin could do is prevent duplicate hashes from being posted. I wouldn't be able to download your media, unlock it, then post it as my own...

Web Page miners are the closest thing to this sort of system currently existing, and they illustrate some of the problems with this system. The problem is that big players can deploy powerful machines, which will be so powerful compared to a consumer device, that the consumer device cannot mine enough coin for it to be worth it. The only way for it to be profitable is if many consumer devices all work together for the benefit of a single person for a very long time - the more powerful the biggest players are, the more small players need to work together, and for longer periods of time. 

This makes it only practical for malware, so that many consumer devices all work together for the benefit of one person, enough to compete with the biggest machines on the network.",1642079434.0,1

Well, maybe it isn’t the best option, if there’s better ways I don’t know about.

The crypto community feels like the type of crowd that would be most interested in it. The inspiration for the idea came from a mix of the Brave Browser and NFTs, so I just assume crypto is the arena in which this idea would work best.

With your suggestion of shasum, does it have the same decentralization and public ledger security that blockchain offers? Does it require or allow any kind of third party involvement to verify? Would it work with cryptocurrency and crypto mining in the same integrated way a blockchain does? Could it be coded to survive copying and peer-to-peer sharing and still work every time the file and/or its copies is played in perpetuity (or at least, as long as the creator stays connected to the system, at which point the mining could either stop or just all go to the viewer)? If so, then maybe it would be the best way to go, but I just assumed blockchain would be the best way to go about something like this.


“Would you use Youtube if every video you watched, arbitrary code by the video creator is run?”

No, but… this wouldn’t be “arbitrary” code. It would be an established system that people agree to use, and the only thing that would change from video to video or creator to creator is the content and/or the wallet the crypto is being sent to. That’s it. Everything else would be as consistent, verifiable and consented to as using a certain video codec to watch a certain video format. What’s “arbitrary” about that?

I’ve already addressed the concern about trojans, malware and piracy, and how they’re already a problem with every form of content distribution we already use.

Nothing’s stopping Disney from putting malware into the code for streaming Disney+ content or downloading a piece of paid content… except for the fact that if they did that, people would find out and nobody would use Disney+ anymore.

Nothing’s stopping people from putting malware into torrent files on The Pirate Bay. And they do! But guess what?! People still take their chances and download pirated torrents every damn day, learning to avoid certain uploaders if they gain a bad reputation, etc… but there’s still tons of trusted content that is clean and accessible, and most importantly FREE at the point of transaction, which is why so many people continue to pirate content. 

That is pretty much all I want. That exact same model as the torrent/piracy system, except in a legitimate, legal system that would ensure the content owners get paid for their work, instead of getting nothing like they currently do from pirated torrents. They’d be the ones uploading their own content, instead of pirates who stole it.

And again, even if pirates do still steal it and try to upload on the same system (which wouldn’t work anyway, because the system wouldn’t verify a duplicate upload from someone else), or on some other platform, what could a pirate offer to people that would make them want to download their copy of the file, instead of the creator’s copy? Nothing. Because the creator’s copy is every bit as free and accessible, with the added advantage of having legitimacy and reputation behind it. If a creator so chose, they could find whoever uploaded the pirated version, because the blockchain would provide a public record of it, and charge them for stealing content, just as you would with any copyright infringement done via today’s technology. The public record of the blockchain would itself be a disincentive to pirate, on top of there already being less of an incentive to pirate already-free-and-accessible content. For the same reason most Youtubers don’t have to worry about their content being pirated, the content already being free tends to nip the desire for a pirated version in the bud. People pirate Netflix stuff, though, because Netflix has a subscription paywall. This is why the no-cost-to-the-consumer part is so important.

“Do you know about the log4j exploit? It’s similar in that this would open a window to remote code execution.”

Okay, I get that this is a potential risk, but again… why is that different for this idea than it already is anything and everything that people download and use on their computers? How is it so much more of a concern for this than it is for, say, downloading and running a node for the PI Network, for example, or any other blockchain? How is it more of a risk than what a lot of creators already do by selling a downloadable MP4 through their website?

I mean, is this not what blockchain technology is all about? A system of verification via nodes on a network of computers? The technology/coding expertise needed to figure how to make it as secure as possible would be a given in developing this idea, but I feel like a lot of that work has already been done in blockchains of various uses. What you’re asking me is essentially the same as asking why Bitcoin should be trusted. Does installing a Bitcoin wallet and transferring Bitcoin to it not open these same type of concerns? If not, why not? If so, why doesn’t it invalidate mining or storing Bitcoin, but it invalidates watching videos via the same type of system?

659,CryptoTechnology,Would this be possible?,AWS-77,1641991253.0,171,16,0.64,"Well yeah, the idea is entirely based on the collective mining power of as many viewers as you can get. The consumers would be completely aware of this and agree to it and everything, so I don't know why you're characterizing it as ""malware"". Malware is malware because it's ""malicious"", as in people don't want it in their computers because it does damage or slows things down and often they don't even know about it or can't get rid of it. This wouldn't be anything like that, so how is it malware?

The consumer would download the file and when they open it, they're met with a dialog box that says something like ""Playing this file will run a crypto-miner for the duration of the content. Do you consent?"" ... if they don't, they don't do it. If they do, they click Yes, and the file checks with the system to verify the file is legit and untampered with, passes copyright checks, etc, and then plays it. The miner runs in tandem with the playing of the file, so imagine you make a 10-minute video, so 10-minutes of mining time per view, and get as much as 1000 viewers to view it... that's 10,000 minutes of mining time on your video. Now imagine you get a million views. A hundred million views. A billion views. Like I said, it wouldn't have to be much mined per view for it to add up to a big sum for the creator. If you don't get many views, you don't get many rewards, but what else is new in the world of content monetization?

The concern about people with more powerful machines hogging all the rewards doesn't seem relevant, when the rewards are going to the creator anyway, from wherever they happen to be when they're mined. I'd think that would actually discourage people from lending more processing power than they would need to just to get the video to play, because there'd be no incentive for them to if they're not getting the rewards. They just want the video to play. You could set like a base minimum amount of processing power that's required to verify the file and ensure a base amount of mining, and then add the option to allow more processing power than that, if you wanted, which would raise the collective mining power and generate more rewards for the creator per view, so it'd be an act of generosity on the viewer's behalf to donate their processing power, which I'd imagine people would do if they really like a creator (could even include a tipping option as well if they want to be even more generous). As long as the minimum is an amount that the average iPhone could do (which, come on, those things are getting pretty impressively powerful now and only increasing going forward), then it would be enough to make the system work and get some amount of mining rewards out of each view. If the person's device isn't powerful enough to even reach the minimum, then it would have to be a pretty old device and they should accept the consequences of their lagging on keeping up with technology, the same as if your old phone doesn't support a new app or OS.

So looking at it this way, if the average processing power across all viewers' devices was enough to generate, say, a cent's worth of crypto for about 10 minutes of viewing, then if you got a million views, you'd have a thousand bucks for 1 million views on a 10 minute video. The same for half a million views on a 20 minute video and so forth. Feature films could generate around $120,000 from a million views at that rate. Now imagine the value of the cryptocurrecy goes up to make it so you're mining $1 worth for 10 minutes of viewing. A 2-hour movie now makes $12 million from only 1 million views. A 3-hour movie makes $18 million. Now imagine you're Hollywood, where you can attract tens of millions or hundreds of millions of viewers with movies that people will watch again and again for years to come... think major studios and rich filmmakers might be interested in investing at this point? Crypto price goes up, rewards go up... so on and so on.

Maybe those amounts are overly-optimistic, but it would all depend on how well the cryptocurrecy's price does, and like I said, if the system attracted the attention of the likes of Hollywood, Bollywood, the music industry, television studios, news media, etc... that price could get pretty damn high with not a lot of mining needed per view to generate substantial rewards from mass amounts of views.",1642088757.0,1

&#x200B;

>The inspiration for the idea came from a mix of the Brave Browser and NFTs, so I just assume crypto is the arena in which this idea would work best.

The basic attention token (BAT) is pretty much as close as a solution creators can get to getting paid in a safe and reliable way for their content. It trades off reliance to third party advertisers to user safety and ease of use. In a sense, your proposed idea is similar to brave but with this balance tweaked.

&#x200B;

>With your suggestion of shasum, does it have the same decentralization and public ledger security that blockchain offers?

shasum is a checksum  program that can produce a deterministic hash string given the same input. This could be used in combination with digital signatures to verify that the file contents + signature is valid making files linked to their original creator as long as the file and signature have not been modified. This is not hard to implement using existing code libraries. It is decentralized (trustless) in that the user is able to verify for themselves that a file is untampered. This would just be a technique that could be integrated into the entire ecosystem but does not offer middle man less content payments.

&#x200B;

>What’s “arbitrary” about that?

It's arbitrary in that it would be different for each file. Each file/content creator would have to set their own crypto mining script to run. And people with bad intent can do much worse than having a crypto miner run while the file is open.

&#x200B;

>And again, even if pirates do still steal it and try to upload on the same system (which wouldn’t work anyway, because the system wouldn’t verify a duplicate upload from someone else)

Your file system will still use existing file formats such as mp4 for videos and mp3 for audio under the layer of abstraction the new format provides. People can and definitely will extract the underlying content though reverse engineering or what not to extract the raw content. Then these files can be wrapped in your new file again but with the pirate's payout address.

&#x200B;

>what could a pirate offer to people that would make them want to download their copy of the file, instead of the creator’s copy?

The pirate's copy is there to deceive unsuspecting people and ""steal"" views from the original creator.

&#x200B;

>If a creator so chose, they could find whoever uploaded the pirated version, because the blockchain would provide a public record of it, and charge them for stealing content, just as you would with any copyright infringement done via today’s technology.

You seem to want the files tracked via blockchain. But what is the merit in tracking static files on a decentralised server? Again, blockchain is overkill for your idea. Also, just from the nature of blockchain and international law, the creator won't be able to find out who the pirates are and take them to court. A content publisher, whether original or pirate, will always just be a public key represented on the blockchain making it impossible to find out who owns the public key.

&#x200B;

>why is that different for this idea than it already is anything and everything that people download and use on their computers?

Because the file type you have proposed is an EXECUTABLE script/program with attached content. People go around torrenting movies off the internet because the file format is just a multimedia storage dump where no code is executed. A crypto miner is fundamentally a script that runs on a computer where as a MP4 file is a bunch of data that is interpreted and displayed by a MP4 player. It has no other capabilities that storing data.

&#x200B;

>Does installing a Bitcoin wallet and transferring Bitcoin to it not open these same type of concerns?

Because Bitcoin wallets don't execute crypto miners or any other arbitrarily set code. Your system would be similar to having bitcoin wallets that allow people to send code fragments to each other and then having those fragments executed on the recipients machine when they open their wallet.

&#x200B;

>All that’s different is the code would contain the data that makes up a video instead of a Bitcoin token

That's what you are misunderstand. When you make or receive a bitcoin transaction, no code is executed on your local hardware where as with your system, a crypto miner, which is CODE, is executed on your machine. The difference being, the file affects your machine where as a bitcoin transaction cannot. There cannot be a zero trust model going on when you have to trust the content creator that they haven't included malicious code in their content.

&#x200B;

I don't even think the piracy potential of your system is even an issue. It's just a side effect. The biggest issue is that the model allows for scripts/code to be executed on user's machines and the single point of trust is the file uploader. This is  a fundamental flaw that I would face if I was tasked with creating such a system. I'm sure there are smarter people who can come up with ideas to make middle-man less content payment systems or better yet implement your system in a way that is safe for users, but I, and many people in this thread, don't seem to think that is possible.",1642163412.0,1

In short: it’s a good idea, it’s just that nobody has been able to figure out how to actually do it in practice. 

As I see it, the crux of the problem is wrapped up with block rewards. Let’s start with blockchains that have constant block rewards - meaning, the amount of crypto mined per block is constant no matter how many people are mining.  The amount of crypto you mine is therefore approximately proportionate to the _fraction_ of total compute power your device has compared to the compute power of the rest of the computers in the network combined. With Bitcoin, this means that if you mine on a cellphone for a hundred years, you won’t make a single penny (or something on that scale). 

On the other hand, let’s say your blockchain has variable rewards, so that more mining means more crypto created per block. Here, you face a different problem: inflation of the coin. If the rate of inflation goes up as mining increases, the value of the coin may plummet. I won’t matter if it means that low powered devices are able to mine at least a small number of coins, because those coins will have so little value it wont matter.

Here’s what would happen in the system your imagining: people would mine crypto for themselves by consuming the content that they create, and they would do this with powerful machines.  (Nobody has been able to figure out a way of preventing this - for instance, it’s not very difficult make a single powerful machine appear like many smaller machines, so you couldn’t just make a rule preventing large machines) This would drive down the amount of crypto that could be mined on consumer devices - because it’s not about how powerful they are, it’s about how powerful they are _compared to the other miners_. 

I see how you’re trying to construct this system, so that collectively lots of people watching the same video will end up mining enough coin to be worth it together. So far, nobody has been able to figure out the economics of this well enough to make this actually work in practice. In the best case, a small amount of crypto would be mined for videos that go viral, most crypto goes to miners watching their own videos, and every other video would get zero crypto. 

This is why I said it’s well suited for malware. I’m not saying that your imagining malware, I’m just saying that it does actually generate money efficiently in a malware context. With malware, you’d gets lots of peoples devices all mining for you for long periods of time- and this would function similar to the “watching your own videos” scenario I described, which is how most coins would be mined. 

All that being said - it’s still a nice idea! It’s just that there are difficult problems that nobody has been able to solve yet that need to be solved for it to work.",1642111025.0,1

Nobody would be able to repost content on the system or post copyrighted material they don’t own without it being treated the exact same way Youtube would treat it.

The verification would make it so that every file downloaded from a creator’s upload would need to be verified that it matches the original upload, or it won’t play. If someone tries to repost it on the system to monetize it themselves and cut out the creator… the system would detect that upload’s content as matching the content of the original upload, the same way Youtube’s algorithm detects and blocks copyrighted material. The same would go for posting copyrighted material that’s not on the system, where the owners of the copyright in question would have the same recourse they currently have with Youtube. Whatever the copyright laws in the country in question are, they would apply and be enforceable by the system’s algorithms.

I figured this all would have been clear when I said that the files need to be verified to work. It’s part of the reason I assume blockchain technology would work, because it’s all about transactions being approved by verification of authenticity in a decentralized peer-to-peer network.

I feel like you’re still kinda missing the point of the collective mining and the fact that the rewards go to the creator, not the people doing the mining. It doesn’t matter if a person with a cellphone doesn’t have enough power to ever get rewards… as long as they’re contributing even a tiny bit to the collective mining power, then that’s all that matters. To the creator, it doesn’t matter if the rewards are coming from a million people or 1 guy with a supercomputer… it’s all the same to the creator. The point of having a large pool of consumers viewing the content is to spread that around as much as possible, and wherever the balance falls in terms of who’s doing the most mining, then so be it. It’s not a competition between the miners like it is when they’re competing for the rewards, because they’re all just working together to reward the creator. I think that requires a fundamentally different way of thinking about it compared to normal crypto mining, and I’m not sure you or anyone else here is really grasping that aspect of it. If you’re saying that no current blockchain technology could work this way, then I guess I am actually suggesting an evolution of the technology that would require a whole new type of collective mining method to be developed. And yes, I realize that’s a big ask.


The issue of people just viewing their own content to reward themselves… again, so be it, if that happens. I don’t think that would prevent them from still contributing a substantial amount to other creators, because as much as I personally love watching my own content (I made it the way I like it, after all!)… I can’t spend ALL my time watching my own content. Sooner or later, I’m gonna wanna watch some other people’s shit. I’m gonna wanna throw on a movie or tv show or any of the type of content I’m interested in. Nobody would ever JUST watch their own content and NEVER anybody else’s. I mean, do current filmmakers who have movies on Netflix just stream their own shit all day long to rack up views on it so Netflix pays them more? Probably not. And even if they did, I don’t think that’s necessarily a problem at all. In the case of a blockchain, as long as they’re running the node, they would still be contributing to powering the blockchain with their mining, so even if they’re just watching their own content, they wouldn’t just be free-loading.

On the issue of inflation, I do see that being a potential problem, but not necessarily any more so than any cryptocurrency that isn’t hard-capped on supply like Bitcoin is (Ethereum or Doge, for instance). Maybe it could be hard-capped and still work somehow? But I figure not really, once all the coins are mined. Ideally, it wouldn’t be capped, so it can go on in perpetuity, and the creators with a vested interest in keeping the price up would keep re-investing some of their profits back into the system. And again, just imagine how much investment capital would be pumped into it if the likes of Hollywood et al got on board. I think that would overcome inflation for a pretty good while at least. I mean, for example, how long do we think Ethereum can stay valuable enough without a hard-cap to prevent inflation? For that matter, how long do we think fiat currency can remain valuable enough to keep the economy functioning with all this inflation going on? It’s a widespread problem, so again, if other systems that face these same problems have managed to work well enough for as long as they have and/or will… this system could too.

And finally, yes, I certainly understand this is all tough stuff to figure out and make work, but that’s why I came here to see what the actual obstacles are.

Antivir software: all antivit software has a fundamental flaw, it can only find already known malware, it is mathematical impossible to find out what a pice of code does(called the halting problem).

Walled garden: this defeats the whole idea of crypto and blockchain, if you have a central authority like apple(the classic example for a walled garden) they can just give out coins, you dont need to form consent between individuals anymore. You just invented a central bank/company that sells virtual coins and allows its users to interact with their API.

671,CryptoTechnology,2 questions about blockchain supply chains?,The_GodKing,1641897819.0,64,13,1.0,"This article is useful for understanding the applications of blockchains for supply chains:

https://hbr.org/amp/2020/05/building-a-transparent-supply-chain

Blockchain technology has a few beneficial characteristics that you mentioned: immutability, transparency, and decentralization. However, private rather than public blockchains can be designed in a centralized way that still utilizes the other benefits. This is what IBM, Walmart, and some other companies are doing for supply chain blockchain tech. Some highlights from the article:

“A blockchain is valuable partly because it comprises a chronological string of blocks integrating all three types of flows in the transaction and captures details that aren’t recorded in a financial-ledger system. Moreover, each block is encrypted and distributed to all participants, who maintain their own copies of the blockchain. Thanks to these features, the blockchain provides a complete, trustworthy, and tamperproof audit trail of the three categories of activities in the supply chain.”

“Blockchain thus greatly reduces, if not eliminates, the kind of execution, traceability, and coordination problems that we’ve discussed. Since participants have their own individual copies of the blockchain, each party can review the status of a transaction, identify errors, and hold counterparties responsible for their actions. No participant can overwrite past data because doing so would entail having to rewrite all subsequent blocks on all shared copies of the blockchain.”",1641953053.0,9

NFTs are, as you said, an entry in a database. By themselves, they are useless, just as useless as a monkey picture, a ""plot of land"" in a game that never launches, etc.

But your house deed, or your car registration are also a registries in a database somewhere...  the difference is the correct people pay attention to that database entry, and act accordingly.

NFTs are the same... by themselves they are just a piece of information saying ""bob owns XYZ"", but if a government minted then, and recognized the NFT as the deed to your house, then it's a deed. If a sports company mints them, and recognizes them as a valid ticket, then it's a ticket. If EA recognizes that NFT as your legendary pink camo skin, then the NFT IS a pink camo skin.

Making normal ""database entries"" into NFT has some disadvantages. For example, manipulating them (buying, selling, minting) has an inherent network cost to it. They are slower than printing a paper ticket, or saving a database record to a centralized database, etc.

They also have advantages: They are in a public space so they can be verified (travel companies can't overbook a plane without it being noticed, EA can't mint more than 100 of the ""Only 100 limited edition Messi shirt""), also, you can trade or sell the NFT to whoever you want (when you get bored of that pink camo skin for example), also, no-one needs to know WHO you are, whoever can cryptographically prove they own the NFT ""own"" the asset the NFT represents.",1641815172.0,20

694,CryptoTechnology,Giving life to NFT's,AnonymousOceanStorm,1641810292.0,210,48,0.79,"Some comments:

1. NFTs are tokens, not the art. You are not paying to obtaint the artefact, you are paying to be registered as the token-owner.

2. Blockchains have limited and costly storage, whereas artworks have presumably high definition preferences. So art is not stored on the chain. Instead, a pointer to a URL is stored. Presumably that contains the requisite art, but if the server goes down/stops serving it/serves something else then you won't find your chosen artwork there, you'll find a 404 or whatever.

3. Blockchains are deterministic - a block has to be verified, which means everyone verifying it has to reach the same conclusion about the resulting block.  In some chains (Blockchain, Ethereum) the entity mining a block is unknown, so you can have future information which isn't known until the block begins to be mined, but you can't insert randomness inside the block in any chain I've seen.

4. As blocks have to be verified, everyone can run the algorithm to work out what the block contains. So even if you did store the artefact on chain, everyone can check that the new version of the artefact is correct, so they can also generate it.

5. Blockchains solve one specific problem: that in a digital era where all information is easily perfectly copied, it is hard to construct a system that enforces scarcity. So NFTs are tokens which are constructed to be scarce, in as much as you need the owner's permission to modify the ledger entry. Trying to use this system to create a non-copyable or non-replicable artefact misses the point; artefacts are assumed to be replicated perfectly.

6. Suppose you wanted to create such a system to create a time-dependent artefact, e.g. it has the date in the corner which is updated every day, and you still want this on the chain because you want that time-dependence to be independent of any centralized image server. This would mean that at least one block of the chain every day has to include the regeneration of your image, and you would have to pay the gas fees for this regeneration, every time.

To be honest, this goes against the point of a distributed ledger - if you want to prove you're the current owner of the token, you point to the public ledger and let people check for themselves.

If you want to create an artefactory which combines your artefact with the date and your ownership proof, then that might be a fun service, but it's one that would exist parallel to the ledger, not on it or generated by it.",1641838598.0,1

My gut feeling is no, because blockchains in general and autonomous contract chains like Ethereum in particular act like one collectively-run, slow computer. So requiring that it does a computation so unreasonably hard that no one could get to the answer quicker seems not to fit.

It might be possible with a function as you describe, in that the verification doesn't have to be as slow, but you still require the computation to be performed by every mining node, and if the computation wasn't contained and continued in every block, then it could be outpaced. 

None of this improves the energy wastage argument against PoW chains.

Ultimately assuming that some function's eventual output can't be predicted by someone out there with a faster computer ignores the reality that there are some people out there with faster computers.

Fees have several purposes:

* pay miners (and proposers on the beacon chain)
* prevent loops and infinitely execution of pseudo-turing complete code
* Gas arbitrage

EIP-1559's purpose is to make fees more predictable, not necessarily to make it cheaper. And it also keeps the overall monetary inflation almost negligible. (Despite most people misunderstanding, its current circulating supply is less inflationary than Bitcoin's, but monetary inflation isn't necessarily bad in the first place.)

Without high fees, the network security degrades, and you can't expect it to hold on altruism alone.

Ethereum's ecosystem is sustainable indefinitely even with its proof of work consensus. Bitcoin and most blockchains are unsustainable with current transaction fees. When Bitcoin's block subsidy declines by 99% in 30 years, its transaction fees are probably going to go up 5-50x. Similarly, many blockchains subsidize their block rewards and staking for 5-10 years. Those blockchains will also need to transition to a different economic model once they approach their time bomb.

Yes it's still expensive but at the time it was expensive AND unpredictable meaning you could pay $250 for a transaction and still have it not go through and lose the fee anyway because you didn't accurately predict the cost. I think they acted out of pressure and really pushed this protocol through out of needing to act. 

Prioritizing deflation through burning also gives a little head start to the idea of rewarding those with a bigger hold of ETH which was never really a thing before. The idea is that over a long enough time, the more ETH you hold the better off you'll be if it's deflationary and it's meant to reward those people, not average joe users. Again I'm not sure exactly why this was prioritized over sidechain development but here we are, it's just how the devs decided to go about it. I'm speculating but maybe they saw the rise of other L2s and sidechains and see that as a bandaid for the time being, allowing them to focus their energy on the PoS merge/difficulty bomb which seems to be their #1 priority at this point, and putting sharding on the backburner for now",1641911422.0,2

No. If the market decides that a unit of gas is worth 100 gwei, then it's worth 100 gwei at that specific point in time. The fact that ~90% gets burned doesn't mean that the fair market value is actually 10 gwei and everyone else is overpaying by 90 gwei. If you artificially reduce the basefee so that the cost is 10 gwei, then you'll just suffer the known consequences of price fixing. If anything the priority fee would then jump to 90 gwei and the miner would get it.

EIP1559 didn't change the market value of gas, it just overhauled the dynamic. Instead of miners getting that 100 gwei, the network gets it. It makes more sense this way, the network is offering blockspace, not the miners. The miners are basically ""employees"" providing security to the network and getting compensated for it with the reward of 2 ETH every block they mine.

In order for proof of stake to work, there must be some value accrued to the token on the base chain.

It makes your fund highly illiquid, requires nearly 100% uptime, all the bandwidth/storage costs of running a node, and gets you a much bigger exposure to the inherent risks of the network (can't pull out your money as easily if something goes wrong). This is a non-negligible cost, especially given the very high minimum amount of funds required to stake. 

>no reason to give any control 

what control?? There is no on-chain governance. You don't get to control much as a validator. It's not an active ""i have money therefore all the power to change the rules"" scheme, it's more of a passive ""i have money, i put it up as a stake to show i won't mess with anything so that I dont get it slashed"". The most you can do as a validator is censor transactions, and even then it's pretty rare for any given validator to get selected for a block proposal. With proposer/builder separation this control will be mitigated even more.

IRRELEVANT TINY COST. you can have just part of your funds stake, in fact pos lets you sell part of coins from reward while still being able to grow % control you have at same time. and the key here is unforgeable costs that automatically adjust to make sure costs are as large as rewards, not some miniscule costs of having uptime. that's nothing compared to billions of dollars in rewards and completely free 72 million eth premine just for 1 party.

\> what control??

making blocks, mev, censorship

and just like with any blockchain, incentives control blockchains so they get to change rules ona whim including who owns what allowing confiscations, dilutions, and so on like the imbeciles of ethereum foundation have already done

\>  it's pretty rare for any given validator to get selected for a block proposal

rare lol. with 72 mil free central eth split between easily sybil'able millions of nodes you can run you can ensure you'll be selected way more than any outsider. censoring users is literally what makes it a 100% permissioned system as we ALWAYS knew about pos and fact stake has owners.

That's why its so important PoW depends on an external resource like matter/energy that's permissionless and makes it unforgeably costly on top of that to take away all incentive to control and why PoS has always been just something that requires infinite illiteracy on this topic. PoS is ""secure"" in same way a database is secure, and that has nothing to do with permissionless protocols.

and there's also ability to selectively devalue incentives/incentives for particiapnts in any soft/hard forks of the blockchain via external markets that ethereum foundation has literally done before to control eth that remains in any consensus system [https://medium.com/@WhalePanda/ethereum-chain-of-liars-thieves-b04aaa0762cb#.66xdzc8nd](https://medium.com/@WhalePanda/ethereum-chain-of-liars-thieves-b04aaa0762cb#.66xdzc8nd)

\> okay you're one of those people

yes, one of the people that actually knows this subject matter so basically like everyone outside of premine scam communities.

Have fun proving all of basic math wrong as that's the premise that is needed to claim ethereum has ever been decentralized.

Giving yourself a dollar is free: -1 + 1 = 0

premine is a central point of control with 1 party having more control everyone else can have combined w/o central permission: 72m/supply > (supply - 72m)/supply

1 central party in control is not 2+ parties in control: 1 < 2+

You can audit it yourself just fine. They can't magically print themselves more coins without breaking consensus rules, and they can't hide coins that haven't had an appropriate state transition. This is literally why all the initial transactions are all there in the genesis block: https://etherscan.io/block/0

>IRRELEVANT TINY COST

Exactly! Much tinier costs for the same economic security (if not more) as PoW. Win win for energy usage globally, and win win for the minimum viable issuance which is why it will drop drastically post-merge. But once the supply shock happens you will switch from calling the merge ""a false promise who will never happen, from devs who constantly never delivery"" (or whatever) to ""a coordinated gimmick with no other goal than to pump the price"". 

>making blocks, mev, censorship

Oh okay so exactly the same control miners have today then. Better make it so the control goes toward someone with an actual *stake* in the network, no? Rather than someone who just wastes energy to win a hash lottery and then sell the coins for a profit. Why let people extract value like that?

>with 72 mil free central eth split 

You're delusional. There's less than 9 million staked, and the staking cap will likely be around 30 million. The ethereum foundation does NOT own 72 million Ether. Your math is all fucked up lmao

Polkadot's main offering is security - every chain using the same security so there's no hiccups in how chains communicate / transact with each other but that takes away sovereignty as you can't really customize your chain to a degree that may be required and adds a risk of complete network exploitation should a vulnerability be found - that's the risk of having a single point of failure. Developers are forced into Polkadots framework and the $DOT token or they simply can't build on it - but if you do, you don't have to worry about security. Polkadots network is currently also a lot more expensive than Cosmos if you look at fees, staking requirements etc.   

Cosmos's main offering is sovereignty and customization - you are given a Cosmos SDK and you can build w/e chain you want with it, with an ability to customize various modules to your liking or your chain needs. Cosmos will also offer Interchain security but unlike Polkadot, no one will be forced into using it - projects can build their own validator networks if they like. The same with $ATOM token, you are not forced to use it to utilize the Cosmos network - in contrast to $DOT. There's some baseline requirements that a chain must meet to connect to the Interchain and it remains to be seen if they are sufficient security wise for the network to continue healthy functioning - so far there hasn't been any problems or exploits. It is also much cheaper to utilize Cosmos to chase yields on the network, staking, etc. 

Gavin Wood sees Cosmos as competition these days (few years ago he saw it as complimentary) as Cosmos's 'Internet of chains' or as it's called 'IBC' went live earlier last year and has been growing with prominent chains connecting to it:

https://mapofzones.com/?testnet=false&period=24&tableOrderBy=totalIbcTxs&tableOrderSort=desc

786,CryptoTechnology,ELI5 Interoperability: cosmos vs polkadot,yasserius,1641720114.0,144,92,0.99,"Polkadot is kind of a Unity for blockchains, it gives you a standardized SDK (Substrate) with which you build blockchains without the hassle of setting up bridges between them or having to worry about spinning up your own validators. But the bigger value is from the pre-built modules.

For projects it essentially turns developing a blockchain into the functional equivalent of developing a smart contract dApp on Ethereum. Only you get a lot more customizability because you have control over many of the underlying systems, e.g. which token to use for gas fees, who pays for gas and how, what kind of features the blockchain has natively etc.

An underrated benefit is that Polkadot gives you clout and distribution. If you're parachain you get a ton of marketing and BD exposure, kind of similar to an app store. Imho the validator thingy is not as relevant, even if Polkadot marketing loves to rave about it. You still need to work on getting collators and paying them, so the burden is similar.

Cosmos is bit more lower level than Polkadot, but very similar. It's a bit harder to give a game dev analogy, I guess it's kind of like using an Xbox/PS SDK? In that you're given the basic tools but you still need to work on your own modules for most things. 

Cosmos is definitely much more confederated than Polkadot. You'll notice that the success of LUNA or OSMO had virtually no impact on ATOM. Part of it is non-existent tokenomics, but it also reflects the fundamental separation between the Cosmos blockchains.

* Ethereum started as a single chain, and is aiming to build many additional sub-chains (rollups) that all share the same security and are interoperable
* Cosmos is currently an ecosystem of many independent blockchains, and is aiming to add shared security and interoperability (through IBC)
* Polkadot aims to launch with independent, interoperable chains with shared security

You can see that they all have the same goals, but some have opted to launch earlier and add features later, while others have opted to build a complete project before launching.

IMO, they all have the right goals, it's just a question of who can execute best. Ethereum has massive network effects, but it's more challenging to build rollups on top of an existing chain. Polkadot has a very comprehensive design, but the fact that it's taken them so long to start rolling out Parachains means other projects have attracted more marketshare.

But we are actually comparing an Azure/AWS approach of Polkadot, in which developers don't need to worry about reinventing the infrastructure, with going from pure Javascript to jQuery ""SDK"" (Cosmos approach).

 I don't think a development team will choose between them, for the team it will be pretty obvious what they want. Most new teams and some existing teams will pick Polkadot because they can focus on adding value to the users without worrying how much CPU they will need in 5 years and buying a server (analogy to AWS/Azure) and the existing teams who already have a chain and need to pivot to an ecosystem will probably choose Cosmos because they can replicate with a finer granularity their already built security mechanism (analogy to SDK)

We have no data for bitcoin bear markets that represent times of global economic downturns. And it's exactly an  economic downturn that's expected to occur for the upcoming years. If BTC drops 65% and takes 2 years to recover in a historic bull market, imagine how much it drops and how long it takes to recover in a historic bear market.

And now that you've imagined this, ask yourself the following: will the upcoming economic climate to come in the next few years be more of what we've already had these previous 12 years, or will it be more representative of the times we've had post 2000 or post 2008?

The economy may not be booming for the next few years. We we run into a global recession, or even just a slow down, the crypto market could get hammered. 

I am long on crypto, but being realistic is important. Crypto's recovery will be impacted by macroeconomic factors. And if the world economy slows down, or even just one or two large nations like the US, China, or a few larger EU countries (let alone the entire EU), crypto prices could remain suppressed in the short-to-medium term. As recessions can last a year or more, a quick recovery may not happen. With that said, high inflation, raised (but still super low) interest rates in the US, and Covid-related supply chain issues, may not be enough to suppress the economy. If the economy bounces back, crypto will likely come roaring back. 

Another important point to consider is the coins you hold. If we do enter a recession (which may not happen), alts will bleed more than BTC. And many alts with great potential may die out.",1642892608.0,3

I remember a while back watching a video on FED interest rate hikes and each and every time they've increased rates it never goes as high as the previous time and it doesn't last as long.

This fits nicely with your chart because every dip seems to be cause by interest rate hikes, and each crash is also getting shorter and shorter like the hikes too.

This is because the US literally cannot afford to pay back its debt at higher rates and so they end up having to print even more money to pay the debt.

This post will likely help bring a few of us back from the ledge. Unless you are over-leveraged (in which case you have most likely already been liquidated), best game plan is to HODL and DCA into this for as long as it takes to recover. Crypto is NOT going away.

One lesson I learned on here from successful traders is to DCA in but also DCA out. Since I was accumulating my position over the 2nd part of last year (mostly UpOnly), I did not see the point in taking profits at ATH (Greedy). I sold a few but not nearly enough, and now I realize that the profits from those sales could have been put to excellent use right now!

Where is all this Bitcoin demand going to come from as the Fed 

1. starts raising interest rates -which makes safe cash and bond deposits earn significantly more than now.

2. ends bond purchases in March - which further increases interest rates and reduces liquidity for risk/speculative buying like crypto.

3. starts reducing its 9 trillion dollar balance sheet - which will strengthen the dollar and again increases bond yields as there’s less demand.

Basically if they want to be decentralized they need to make it possible for authentication without such a huge initial investment.  Hell just pay the auth in sol enough to make one a day and you'd have a shitload of auth up in like a week.",1642876314.0,9

And it happened because the highest inflation happened when no one knew about the project, and also because ASICs came in and there was ONE company producing them for many years, and even still today dominates that market.  That central supply gave a vast outsized power and influence to the narrow set of corporations that sprung up around that supply.

Most of what you said is just narrative and tribalism. I don't care about nakamotism, or Ver, or Segwit.

I care that govts can, have, and will continue to target ASIC installations. You think it was over with China? Nope.

Big buyers want more of it because it works reliably, and concentrations of supply doesn't control a chain on POW.  

Nakomotoism is a made up term, not a tribe.  I use it to describe the motive towards decentralization shared by many cryptos.  And bitcoin and litecoin have done fantastically at that.  The history of segwit isn't about tribes either, it's about proving the companies that had the power you're worried about could not control the chains you said they controlled.  If what you were saying was true, if those centralized forces could control the chain, segwit could not have been adopted.  They tried to kill it, put all their resources to doing so and failed.  Ignore history if you want, but that is the history of decentralization being tested and proven up vs. just assumed.    

As to your predictions of the future, well, even your predictions of the past didn't work out.  So good luck with that.

When it’s over/under represented in your portfolio compared to your targets.

For example, if your target allocation is 75% BTC and 25% USDC, then when BTC drops to <70% it means it’s low, so use some USDC to buy some until it’s back up to 75%, and when BTC increases to >80% it means it’s high, so use some BTC to buy USDC until it’s back down to 75%.",1642869326.0,2

Remember that debt doesn’t come due like all at once. It comes due every year little by little and they issue new debt all the time. It’s just a rolling cycle. All the government has to do is out grow the interest they are charging on the debt and they will eventually pay off the debt if they decided to stop issuing new debt or issue debt at a slower rate than they have in the past. 

Being in-debt doesn’t really matter at all. If you can make the interest payments you’ll eventually pay off the debt. And the US government has made its interest payments without an issue for decades.

El Salvador isn't the holder and creator of a reserve currency. They are throwing tax dollars (of which they have little) into one of the most volatile currencies IN THE HISTORY OF MAN. No fucking shit that regime is being criticized for being moronic. You have more governments restricting access to crypto markets. Furthermore, more financial regulations means lesser support from the very institutions that are inflating the price as it is. On top of that, bad actors can skull fuck the monetary basis and stability of your country. People won't want to use bitcoin or sats because day to day you can have massive swings in power relative to the tangible good. Sure, El Salvador will likely come out better from this crash. They can DCA and increase their relative power of currency per coin. The problem is that this will not benefit the country as much as a single individual. You can fucking bet that these coins will disa-fucking-ppear the minute he gets ousted. On top of that, without investment in ACTUAL infrastructure (education, power, internet and telephone connectivity, roads, etc.) a fucking city will be non-sustainable. It is a fucking pipe dream that sounds good and captivates the audience without creating meaningful progress. Not to mention the fact it will literally create a wider divide between the majority of the country and the individuals lucky enough to live there. You know, one of the largest justifications for violent revolution in the world. 

The US government inflating away the value of the debt is a GOOD fucking thing. Every day, we reduce the actual impact of the debt. We won't ever pay it off because there is really no need to. Should the government be spending money they don't have? No. However, simply saying that it is wholly evil is such an uninformed take. Sure, there are issues with inflationary monetary policy. There are tradeoffs to literally every financial decision made. Typically individuals who aren't divested from the currency get burned (the poor). The stimmies everyone and their fucking mother loved was a noose around the neck of the poor and no one gave a shit because it benefitted the markets. Funny how you didn't post about this during the stimmie rush when the markets were fucking blasting off. The reality is that many of the countries who hold US debt equities don't really want us to pay them back. They want interest streams that act as positive cash flows on their books.

Meanwhile US government sitting on $30 trillion debt that will never be paid back.,KAX1107,1642883225.0,186,472,0.84,"I have said this before, and will say it again. Crypto is not yet in a place where it is ready for national adoption. It will be there one day. But it is too volatile. And even those like me who are very active in the crypto space mostly use it as an investment vehicle. 

I have never bought an item with crypto. Sure, I have had the opportunity. But the transaction cost is too high. And asking me to spend crypto is like asking me to spend my stocks instead of fiat. I would not want to do it and keep it invested. 

Moreover, my major activity with crypto is in the DeFi space across ETH, ALGO, and Cosmos (technically Osmosis). Again, DeFi is more an investment than currency use. 

All this is not to say crypto won't be in a space where it can be a currency down the road. Some crypto, likely not a store of value crypto like BTC, will likely one day be a viable currency option. However, major countries will likely use centralized blockchain technology for their digital assets as decentralization of currency by global powers like the US will likely not happen in the next decade or two. But decentralized crypto options will likely exist. But right now, the crypto space is too volatile. 

I can afford to invest in crypto. I am not super rich. But I have money and am financially independent. I have a good job. I own a few rental properties. I have a 401k. I have post-tax equity investments. And I invest in crypto. I can afford to lock away funds for the long-term. But even I would balk at 100% of my assets being in crypto. The volatility risk is too high. Yes, fiat loses about 3% of its value per year in the US (historical average with some years with well over 10% inflation and others with near 0% inflation). But crypto can gain or lose 50% of its value in a week or two. Most people can't afford the cost of food doubling in a week. Or rent doubling (or more) the next time their lease agreement is renewed. 

Sorry for the jumbled thoughts here, but the bottom line is crypto is not yet ready to be a currency. It will one day. The first step will likely be digital currencies run on centralized blockchains. Eventually, decentralized currencies may be an option. For the next decade or so, crypto (outside of centralized digital currencies on blockchains) is more an investment than a currency.",1642893176.0,1

The Fed is looking to take away the punch bowl for real this time. Inflation is threatening the USD as the world's reserve currency. The consequences of all that money printing and QE over the past 10 years is coming home to roost.

If the Fed kept their tight money policies, BTC would have never exceeded $1,000 and ETH wouldn't be worth more than $100.

Most people here have no idea what the last crypto winter felt like.

---

Bitcoin had failed as it was defined by it's whitepaper (being a currency).

Bitcoins fees were insanely high, with no real scaling solution on the horizon.

Bitcoin was being REMOVED from stores (ie. Steam) as a payment method.

Bitcoin did not have any insitutional investment.

Bitcoin did not have the 'store of value' narrative.

Ethereum was having the same scaling issues.

Ethereum had high fees.

Ethereum was crippled by CryptoKitties.

---

Things were looking BLEAK. Crypto was still a massive gamble back then, and I don't fault anyone for deciding to sell. 

I personally sold half of my stack at the covid crash. After all that shit, the last thing going for it was this new narrative that Bitcoin was digital gold, and it would retain value while the stockmarket crashed. It didn't. I don't regret this decision. I still stand by my logic in making it.

---

Now? Now is different. 

Crypto is being adopted.

Hedge funds are buying it and recommending people allocate some of their portfolio to it.

Billionaires are investing in it.

Companies are holding a % of their funds in it.

Banks/VISA/etc are integrating it.

Bitcoin is legal tender in a country and will likely expand to be so in more countries.

Crypto is totally different now than it was in 2018.",1642886893.0,1

I don’t think used car prices are gonna continue to increase by 37% like they did last year. They will go back to losing value every year once chip shortage is eased.

The supply chains remain stressed and prices for everything are going up. There are not enough truck drivers, cargo ships, etc., because people have been taken out of the workforce by the virus. Price increases for shipping are rippling across the entire economy and are remaining sticky. I believe inflation is here to stay for the immediate term, and the Fed will be compelled to act.

The Chinese are still doing their zero COVID thing, which is hampering production of goods that we consume here for export.

I can't give precise prices or percentages or anything but I believe that the trajectory of this sell-off will follow what happened in late 2018, the last time the Fed attempted to raise rates. The Fed did step back in 2019 because of political pressure, but Biden selected JPow to continue in his role as Fed Chair because the guy has the balls to raise rates and shrink the balance sheet before and was somewhat hawkish before becoming Fed Chair.

I've been HODLING some since 2014 and it's turned out great, but that doesn't mean it will work forever. I don't believe crypto will collapse forever, but BTC could, maybe in a few years the fact that it's not Proof of Stake will finally kill it, maybe in the next bull run ETH will be the top coin, who knows.

Historically, selling at -50% after an ATH hasn't been so bad all things considered—assuming you bought long ago and you're still in the green. It's hard to sell before that because bitcoin is so volatile that 30-40% drops are common in the middle of bull runs. So, if you bought 1-2 bull runs ago, getting 50% of an ATH now is not bad and it's likely you could buy back later at lower levels.

I perfectly remember 2017 and regretting for years to not have sold some at 10K. It felt low when we still had 20K in mind, but in the following months/years, it felt really high.

We can do all the analysis in the world and it won’t tell us what will happen. A recession is definitely possible and that will crash the market. However, the reality is we should of been in a recession a few years ago and governments have artificially been keeping economies afloat by printing money and giving cheap debt. Even with their interest hikes we are taking about 1% interest by the end of the year. Still doesn’t dent inflation. 

The fed are for the rich and the rich don’t want a recession. They can either balance the economy and allow a recession to stop hyper inflation or they can just keep printing money and let inflation go up while the rich get richer and the middle class dies. People are greedy so I wouldn’t be surprised if the later happens and crypto would pump in that situation. Let’s see what their play is. We will require around 5% interest hikes to slow down inflation right now which will definitely put us in a recession. I just think they like their investments too much to do that.

If I put my emergency fund into Bitcoin or Ethereum at 60,000 and I suddenly needed it tomorrow, my fund would be worth almost half what it was. Billionaires can eat the losses with nearly no problem, so buying to them is worth, even if it takes years. Average people do not have that luxury. 

You can say BTC is a long term hedge, but the way the market is now, it COULD be a very long time before BTC hits ATH again. It's just not something the ordinary person can risk holding.

And just because El Salvador keeps buying, doesn't mean you should. I'd bet they could have gotten an even better deal if they held out for any negative American economic news. I'd bet BTC will hit 30,000 soon or go lower, you are talking about a country who was reliant on the USD for a stable economy, and has had a checkered history.

Moody didn't downgrade El Salvador bond ratings recently, that tweet from @Investingcom was wrong.

> due to their irresponsible and crappy implementation of crypto.

The erroneous tweet claimed nothing of the sort. You made that up. 

However, Moody DID downgrade El Salvador's rating back in July 2021, and in their [explanation for it](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-El-Salvadors-rating-to-Caa1-maintains-negative-outlook--PR_450956), they mention Bitcoin and conclude:

> More controversially, on 9 June the Legislative Assembly approved the world's first law to make Bitcoin (a cryptocurrency) legal tender in the country, such that both the US dollar and Bitcoin are now legal currency for settling transactions.

> In Moody's opinion, these measures reflect weakened governance in El Salvador, raising tensions with international partners -- including the United States (Aaa stable) -- and jeopardizing progress toward an agreement with the IMF. 

There's a lot more going on and this is a relatively small piece, but notably this has nothing to do with El Salvador's ""implementation"", and everything to do with their decision to use Bitcoin and how it'll liable to upset the US and others.

On the surface A third world country adopting BTC as a backing for it's central bank, or as a direct currency can be a stabalizing force... even know BTC fluctuates hard... it is hardly as much fluctuation as some currencies in third world countries.

And from a transparency standpoint, if every transaction is on-chain, then you have a very transparent digital currency for your government funds, and maybe for your people.

I won't even pretend to know how their implementation works, but there are plenty of ways through DAO's and through other systems to ensure that trust is maintained in an appropriate way,  The real issue is authorities like Moody, I assume that it was more than the crypto decision that affected the credit rating, but ultimately if a country wants to do something like this, it's going to be high risk, and a credit authority is never going to perceive it as anything but, especially until there is a proven track record for countries succeeding with a crypto model for other countries to follow.

Tldr; he played the Australian labor movement to benefit the American commerce, government, and Australian business corps. Quotes of being a chameleon for the US in Australian colors.

Unlike every other country who's citizens only get predatory loans because they don't have the national average backing to even cover those loans to make the lender comfortable with a reasonable rate

I used to be an hourly price checker but I've since went to glancing at it every few days like I do my stocks. I'm not here to trade, I'm not here to get rich in a few days/weeks/months or even years, I started with a genuine interest in the technology and recognized the unique opportunity to participate in a completely new market. I don't care what happens to my investments. I was here for ethereum at $100 and $5000. If you have an amount of money invested that makes you physically ill or will ruin your life if it goes away, you should sell, you're already in too deep. Now is the perfect time to learn about crypto and actually use the projects people have been investing in.

I told myself there was no way it could stay that high and that it possibly couldn't increase in value. Boy, was I wrong.

When I first actually invested in Bitcoin, it's price was around $10,000. I kicked myself for not getting in at $500. Then it crashed down to around $3,000. It stayed at those levels for about two years or so. During that time, I stopped investing in it because I thought there was no way it would surge again to levels of $10,000. Boy, was I wrong.

Once it hit $38,000 about a year and a half ago I realized if I had just put in $25 a week when it crashed down to $3,000 the first time, I'd probably have close to 2 Bitcoins to my name. Had I done the same when it was at $500, I would be retired on the French Riviera right now. I could pay off my student debt; I could pay off my mom's mortgage; I could invest in more stable, dividend-earning securities to generate passive income and be set for life.

The truth is, none of us know with absolute certainty what will happen with Bitcoin. But fretting about the crashes has invoked enormous opportunity costs. So, regardless of what happens, I throw in $25 every Friday. I know it seems scary now, but this is isn't the first time Bitcoin has taken us on a rollercoaster and it won't be the last in all likelihood.

* Don't try to ""catch a falling knife"": bear market can and usually last for *YEARS.* **It will probably take this whole year to reach the bottom**, there's no rush.
* Don't get lost watching charts and price movements below the 1 day scale.
* Charts and price predictions are worthless, **pay more attention to the** ***mood of people***. What matters is people's psychology, that is what is predictable and what repeats itself with each cycle. Price patterns don't: just look at this cycle's compared to the 2017 one. Right now there's still people in denial that we're even in a bear market: there's still a long way to do.
* **When things get flat and boring is when you'll want to start serious DCA** while waiting for the ""capitulation"" event to get all in. Capitulation only comes after people are mentally exhausted from many months of downtrend and convinced the bottom is near only for it to shit the bed again. This cannot  be happening any time soon.
* Don't get bamboozled by the price noise on the way down. And as ""noise"" i mean uptrends that can spread across multiple weeks and give false hopes or FOMO. A bear market is not a straight line downwards.
* **Get rid of the hypecoins and the shitcoins,** consolidate in BTC & ETH. Its over now. Next cycle will have its new batch anyways and they'll never get back to ATH. Here's an example wich was obnoxiously permashilled here during the 2017 cycle, barely mentionned in this one, and dead in the next: Vechain.
* It's too late now, but always try to manipulate your own psychology to put yourself in a situation where you can have peace of mind either way if things go up or down: take enough profits when reason dictates it so that if it does go down you can remain calm, but keep enough ""HODL"" so that if you're wrong you don't feel FOMO or regrets either.
* There will be many temptations, but get rid of any hope that ""maybe I will go back up soon"". It's not happening until we go through all the psychological phases of the market cycle. Every rally will get sold out and shorted into oblivion before that.

Hope that can help, ended up longer than I thought.

So advice on coping? Remember your investment objectives and your investment strategy. Were you expecting immediate gains? Longterm growth? Have any of your exit conditions been met? Volatility is a part of this game and it's not a bad thing, it's just the landscape. My advice to cope with it is to learn to be comfortable with it and to avoid the daily temptation and worry of watching your accounts too closely. 


Know your own mental limits. If this volatility is too much of a stressor you need to seriously evaluate if you want to be investing in something so volatile. I say that in all sincerity, because investing is supposed to help your money grow so you can enjoy your real life. If it impedes that enjoyment, being honest with yourself about your risk tolerance will do wonders for your mental and physical health.",1642863097.0,1

Take advantage of this dip to recenter your assets to safer tokens, if you have shitcoin or dubious investment. Since the whole market is down, you will be better off selling your low-cap coins to btc or eth than to USD for example.
2. Keep your assets in lending or some safe liquidity pool. The idea is that if winter is striking, you're better getting 10% extra income during 1 or 2 years.
3. Be patient and don't sell at loss. Unless you have lost faith in a project, I would recommend you to keep your assets. Are you seeing BTC going back to ATH in few months/years? If yes, just find a place where you can get 2 to 5% APY and keep it here.
4. Keep yourself informed. As the market will dive down, the news won't make headlines and you won't hear so much anymore.   
That was a mistake I made post-2018, by completely disconnecting from the cryptoverse.

Volatility is what creates amazing gains in crypto but also can crash just as fast.

Take peace in mind in the fact that it will always go in both directions. Buy on green days and sell on red days, if you will make a profit if you follow this strategy for long enough. Most people lose money in crypto because they buy the hype around ATH and sell any correction. Your money will slowly bleed that way. It isn’t a loss or profit until you pull out. Crypto could go on a bull tear tomorrow or a year from now. I can’t say when but I can promise it will happen and years from now these prices will seem like the bargain of a life time.

The hard part is controlling your emotions. If you need to step away from the charts and focus on other things in life. You will feel less and less with regards of volatility in this market the longer you are in it. 

I’ve been in crypto for 4 years now and have watched my investment drop 90% for over 2 years straight and the pump over 2000% in less than 3 months. This is just the nature of the beast. I didn’t sell those whole 2 years and that was the difference from losing my whole investment and 20x gains. I honestly had to step away for a year though and didn’t look at charts or nothing.

“Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is a strategy where an investor invests a total sum of money in small increments over time instead of all at once. The goal is to take advantage of market downturns without risking too much capital at any given time.”

This means you should continue to DCA during a crash to take advantage of the crash. This is how you get the “average” out of dollar cost averaging. You’re doing it wrong by not buying when everything is down/cheaper. You wouldn’t be “averaging” by stopping. It just goes against what DCA’ing is all about.",1642871629.0,0

         is something, 

That's unsustainable in the Universe as we know it.

If people were really estatic they would have done what a smart trader would do,

Have an exit point like for example 60 k, be ready to lose 5 k and buy back at 65k if wrong, otherwise save months of waiting and agony, by letting it go and buying back double the coins at half the price. 32.5 to 5, so 6.5 to 1 risk to reward ratio. A trade within a trade. This could have been done last April 14th and Nov 13th. RSI divergence is strong both times on thr daily, there are other obvious technical clues.

You can still do it, drop it at 35, and buyback when it surpasses 43.6 (a key key level) again, or whatever price you want that's at least ten percent above, but this greed of trying to catch every penny, has killed people many times before and will continue to do so for eternity.

You need to get your head examined if you believe that. Forget crypto and its veracity as an underlying. That's a different issue. As such,  the people who actually come to crypto are on average a lot more stupid than the average person.

On the other hand, half the planet is below average in intelligence, (should use ""median"" there). So yes, it makes sense, when examined at depth, to a certain extent.

If you're truly in it for the next 5 to 10 years then you shouldn't let what's happening today, this week, this month, or this year effect your exit strategy in the long run.

If it goes to 0 I've already accepted that, don't put in more money then you can afford to lose. If it goes up 1000% from this point, or the bottom, wherever the bottom may be, then you're laughing.

I would rather take on the risk that comes with investing in cryptocurrency and block chain technology, than regret not having ever invested at all and wondering what could have been.

Diversify your investments with index funds and ETFs, save some fiat in a standard savings account and always have enough money in your current account to cover your monthly expenditure.

It does feel a bit crappy to watch your portfolio shrink so much in 2 months, but then looking at the bigger picture and for the longer term, it feels great to accumulate more at a bargain.

I am staking stablecoins and it makes sense to me to do that while there are seas of red everywhere.

Hopefully, DAI will be available soon, they said that there will be more assets available for staking after the V2 launch. Since it's launched already I guess it's just a matter of time.

I will also continue buying the DOT dip. Unique Network crowdloan is getting closer and I am planning to participate so this dip might make my journey a bit less expensive. I already got some amount of UNQ on their token sale 10 days ago but I could always use more since I think that they can reshape the things when it comes to NFT sustainability and scalability.

...And that's usually when they've made their earnings and everyone else who didn't know when to get in when the time was right drool over the earnings these experts made. 

History repeats itself it seems.

I'm new to crypto myself, just jumped in last year and experienced my first crash, I did really badly since I had to start somewhere, and was down half my original investment. 

Then I learned about how to research stuff, and most importantly of all - ignore all the noise out there (yes I'm talking about youtubers and influencers). 

Look at the history of the potential investment you are about to invest in or have some curiosity about, don't buy in before you feel good and ready, and do tons of research. Look at use cases, look at long-term development, look at the current market situation, future perspectives, watch and listen to politics, check the pulse on people around you. Are businesses thriving and rising for your sector of interest? Or is it saturated? Are there new potentials out and about? Research some more.

I can't do that for you, because if I did - I would essentially be your financial advisor which I'm not, and I don't want that because you have your own potential to research with your own sound mind and scepticism, use common sense, it's not easy - but it's doable.

Right now it's not only the Crypto market that is bearish - the entire stockmarked is, we're in a world wide change due to the current world situation, people moving to new jobs, working from home, businesses that was used to walk-in customers are now doing it online, closing down their physical stores etc.

Crypto investing is akin to Startup investing but through a public market. When you invest in a startup, you analyze the team/project/market/solution and buy into it with a longer term return in mind. This requires investors to HODL and have belief in the core team, and give them a chance to find product market fit followed by growth.

Treating crypto projects like they’re mature companies trading on the NYSE/NASDAQ complicates this dynamic, and furthers the synthetic demand problem that leads to bubbles. When masses start doing this, and invest in shitcoins/memecoins and in projects they have 0 understanding in, we perpetuate the greater fool theory which ultimately plays out.

If you’re not going to HODL in crypto you’re more gambling than you are investing. If you are going to HODL based on a strong investment thesis then you’re more investing than gambling. HODL culture is dangerous to gamblers but ideal for investors. 

Long term, it’s the investor mindset that will increase the overall potential and market value that crypto has at a global scale. HODL culture is the safest approach to the long term growth of the ecosystem.

Everyone has a right to trade as they wish (as an investor or a gambler), but to label HODL culture as a dangerous cult is IMO short sighted and aligns with the short sighted views of the gambler mindset.",1642889118.0,1

A lot of people see ""Solana is down"" and end it at that, can't even really explain the reason why. Thinking ""Solana got hacked""/""Solana is centralized""/""Decentralized coins don't go down"". I'd just like to remind people Solana is in ***beta*** and people are getting upset at a cryptocurrency that is in beta. The amount of programs I've seen exit beta with game/program breaking bugs isn't uncommon.

*If most people did their research they'd come to find that Solana is actually going through updates.*

**TL;DR on why Solana went down:**

People (Bob) open leveraged positions on DeFi networks borrowing USDC against SOL collateral. Due to huge volatility those people (Bob) get liquidated. Defi doesn't work like a regular bank. Anyone can be a liquidator and can trigger liquidation of said persons (Bob) position. For successfully doing so they get a reward. So liquidators are all racing each other on the network to liquidate peoples positions during high volatility and spam the network with hundreds of transactions to increase success rate. The network isn't efficient at removing duplicate transactions, so the network is trying to sift through the spam of liquidation bots. This has become a newer issue due to the fact Defi usage didn't really exist 6 months or even a year ago. Defi transactions are much more expensive to compute, so the network is doing a lot more computing recently since the market has been extremely volatile, but Solana team is fixing this in 1.8.14 to fix this issue and as of right now validators are rolling over to 1.8.14 so that's why there's a lack of TPS. 

**Edit: Here's a solution I've found through** /r/solana

From Solana Moderator: 7LayerMagikCookieBar

*So one of the issues right now is bots spamming many many duplicates of the same exact transaction (so same signature). One of the fixes for this being tested on mainnet right now by Certus One validator and Shinobi Systems (Zantetsu) is having a ""dedupe"" (duplicate transaction filter) that is more performant than the previous filter and its now at an earlier stage of transaction processing. For Zan it's looking like it removes about 90% of transactions (because duplicates). The issue is that the amount of spam is literally in the low millions (all day) and so high it almost completely saturates all bandwidth going to validators (causing other transactions to drop). To deal with this there need to be ways of dealing with spam by the network side (perhaps filtering out better and/or blocking certain spam sources) + better economic disincentives to spam (upcoming compute fee model will help some -- but a few weeks away I think). Other than that they need to figure out bottlenecks in block packing -- the blocks are not filling up as much as they technically should so there are parts that need to be optimized so blocks can actually be big ones instead of these weak mini ones. If you want to check out ongoing discussion check out the #consensus channel of the discord, along with #development, and #mb-validators.*",1642848852.0,12

Also transactions are all sent into one hole onto a singular Visa network, it's not a blockchain system what so ever which makes it exponentially easier to compute.

6176,CryptoCurrency,Which coins won’t reach their ATH ever again,Still_Hat6758,1642865248.0,927,194,0.84,"It's kinda crazy NANO didn't get more traction when it had such a distinct advantage specifically answering it's competitor's pain-points when they were most bemoaned (back in ancient times when Vitalik was critical of BTC's tx fees, and Eth's fees well... now).

I do think in the past the NANO community vastly oversold it's ability to scale, but I am kind of surprised that it's never been utilized up to the point of it's real capacity with organic traffic.

Nano's poor adoption, despite it's most attractive features make for an ideal case-study in market-fit (and lack thereof).  It is completely disconnected from why people actually purchase and how people actually use crypto.

I'm genuinely curious to see how it plays out going forward.  IMHO it seems to ""fall between two stools"", as I would personally *never* transact with something that I genuinely expected to appreciate tomorrow becoming the new ""Bitcoin Pizza"" guy, but OTOH it's hard to compete directly with BTC for the ""store of value"" narrative.

I don't know of any L1's that can compete directly with XNO on what it does, but I'm not sure if that matters if ultimately you can achieve feature parity and *more* (wider acceptance, liquidity, easy exchange, better scaling) on L2.  Ultimately, it'll probably just come down to what gets adopted, by whom, and in what order and path dependence will handle the rest.",1642891321.0,2

Everyone who says otherwise is a bit delusional in my opinion.

However, chances are big that we will exit this one much quicker than other bear markets in the past, think of all the big money in it nowadays. Around spring time -also when the number of covid cases will be on the downtrend and speculation will turn positive little by little- there could be a turn around already. Of course what do we know, and there might as well be some new even geopolitical events playing a role, we'll see.

And don't forget, this means major opportunity for us retail, it will be in the following weeks when prices go down more that we are getting this chances presented on a silver platter. Because crypto is here to stay and the bounce back will be immense.

Or in the less extreme case (more so with just 2% or whatever), they do still hand it out to people, but your payments back to them as a borrower are still also higher, because parking it at the Fed will still be better for them than taking *a really narrow margin* would be. So they must raise customers' rates too, meaning it's still less profitable of a loan for a business. Which means fewer businesses and opportunities can start up or expand, make less when they do, people pinch pennies, the economy grows more slowly.

But it's necessary to curb inflation. The above is better than buying bread with wheelbarrows full of $100s, so it kind of has to happen anyway.

And this is all before the expected global regulation of cryptos gets written into government laws, which will include no more avoiding tax loss wash sales, no more hiding your assets and retro taxation of all crypto profits from last year and years before that. PLus maybe outright bans.

I have ties with this country and know first hand, but doing any amount of easy research will show:

-	Some of his top cabinet officials have had their US Visas revoked for verified corruption. Instead of removing them from office, he has chosen to pick a very public fight against the US, claiming this is “external interference”
-	An award-winning investigative journal has revealed that this person’s administration, as with previous corrupt administrations, has cut deals with gangs—less homicides and votes in exchange for favorable prison conditions, and immunity. A telling example is the president’s refusal to extradite a famous gang member to the US for heinous crimes committed there.

For the sake of my own portfolio, and that country’s, I hope crypto is able to stem its bleeding. But to give credence to such a cult-ish following, and to believe this is anything but negligence on that government’s behalf is palpable, laughable stupidity.

If they have it, it won't be hard to find, as they will probably really want you to know as quickly as possible.  There are a lot of great projects hidden on CMC.  I actually browse CMC often to find new projects that might have some value.  The key is to make sure they can actually back up their claims.  You'll often find big claims being made, but when pressed the developers will admit that they haven't broken ground on implementation.  A hidden gem has everything done but they are lacking hype.  In that instance, you can generally have some confidence (when all of the other criterion above are met) that their day in the sun will come at some point.

\-Don’t FOMO.  
\-Buy when no one is buying.  
\-Understand the fundamentals of a project you’re trying to get yourself into.  
\-Beware of scams. There’s a shit ton of them, especially here.  
  
When it comes to how much you should start on, honestly, it doesn’t matter. Your $300 is already more than enough. It is best to start small since you’re just starting and you’re exploring. On my end i started with 200 and just kept hodling.  
  
Also, since you’re going to trade, learn to stop/prevent losses and do risk management. When I first started with crypto, I kind of regretted going into it without completely preparing myself so do your research and be cautious.  
  
Also, if you’re in the US, then you’re going to have problems with binance since it will require you to use a VPN.

&#x200B;

I started as an Index Manager at a mid sized ETF shop 8 months ago. Since my background is in software engineering, I've developed an interesting pipeline for automating the construction and rebalancing of my indices. I use Bloomberg for all of my data, but I also use a proprietary screening model to select constituents. What I have pictured above is the Bloomberg Terminal running in an AWS Workspace in which I also have configured to run CRON-type scheduled jobs. I'm using the local Bloomberg API (for those that don't know, when the terminal is running it starts an api service on a local port) which I then expose to a script running in Github Actions. The script in actions connects to the service running in the AWS workspace, pulls the security universe, and then applies the scoring/screening model. When the selection process is complete, they are automatically send to the index engineer and implemented in the ETFs  


Getting back to my post, running the terminal in the AWS workspace has the fortunate side effect of me being able to access it on my MacBook after hours. It runs surprisingly well with low latency in the workspace, highly recommend.

So far I was betting on Coinbase because it's registered with the German financial authorities, which I thought makes the tax stuff easier and shields me from scam coins (like that Squid Game situation).

But I understand that it's not the ideal platform for the type of scalping I'm trying to do. Of course I've discovered the CoinTracking/etc services in the meantime that run the tax-relevant numbers for me, so that reason is also irrelevant now. But the main point for going away from Coinbase should be the other comment about how it's not a leading market anyway.

It doesn't need to be high-end (using a 1050, for example, would still be much faster than a CPU), the data you're training on and the size of your model is the biggest factor, because it determines how much memory you need.

Edit: To clarify, it's possible to train on CPU, but if you're working on the model, you're going to go through a lot of training, (using different model graphs, data preprocessing, etc...), so it's very time consuming. You train a lot because each time you want to try any changes or improvement to the model, you go through more training. If you got lucky and built a perfect model on the first try, you would only need to train once, but you wouldn't know it was the best model unless you trained some other ones that weren't as good, to prove your first model was the best.

The difference between CPU / GPU is about an hour of CPU training for every 5 minutes on a GPU.

The FDIC has some models and resources for doing that on a simple scale like you want to do. 

Across many banks, look at the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of a bank, along with the weightings used for those ratios from the official documentation. These ratios were designed to help measure a bank’s resilience to a bank run scenario based on a 2008-ish liquidity crisis. With the way the LCR is designed, no covered bank should run out of liquid funds within 30 days. And if liquidity gets so bad that banks are running out of funds, the central bank is certain to intervene with cash today.

Trying to predict a bank run is difficult, and if you are trying to build a trading algorithm based on that you have to consider: how stale is my deposits data for this bank going to be? At what point would the bank’s securities become price-sensitive to this fundamental condition? At the times where bank run risk matters, is this going to be a priced factor for just one bank or a systemic event that shocks all security prices?",1642342433.0,52

However, LCR only tells us the **minimum amount** required by law for a bank to keep at hand as liquid funds at any point in time. And, as you stated it is a constant ratio.

I am trying to build a statistical model that will predict the amount of funds to keep as liquid funds so that if the previous patterns of historical withdrawals and deposits were to continue, there would be a low probability that liquid funds would be exhausted. This, in fact would not account for a black swan bank run type scenario because in those cases, the withdrawal activity might spike, which will not be accounted for in the model. However, for now I just want to build a model that does not necessarily take black swan events like a bank run into account and just the historical patterns of deposits and withdrawals.",1642347496.0,3

Since all banks need to have a LCR > 100%, it’s a much higher threshold than the amount of funds needed to keep liquid for historical withdrawal rates. Because the LCR was designed based off of historical data, satisfying the LCR means the probability of a bank running out of funds based on *historical* withdrawal rates like you want to model will be zero.

Perhaps I don’t understand why you are going to the effort to model something we already know the answer to. Are you trying to use this to predict a bank failure? Do you want to trade bank equity with this model? How much effort do you want to put in to a model that doesn’t give you actionable information?

If you really want to understand this process and you still think it’s worth the effort, read Choudhury’s book The Principles of Banking, especially the chapters on ALM.

8357,algotrading,How do you model news impulses?,CrossroadsDem0n,1642267228.0,36,21,0.86,"Here is how I would do it:

1. Cluster like with like data (i.e. similar new headlines, sec filings, etc.). This would involve some level of NLP in order to properly parse this data and find it's ""similarity score"" with other data --> look into search algorithms for help. Vector search is a good place to start if you are looking for a very technical solution.
2. Use survival analysis on each of the clustered categories from step 1. This will tell you how strong any given signal is and in general what the survival curve of each signal (clustered category) will look like. This step is very relevant if you are looking to parse news, as this data can be very difficult to separate the useful information from the noise. 
3. The final step is to try to find a lead-lag relationship between the modeled out data from step 2 and any underlying asset(s) you find are related to this data. 

For example, you can parse a bunch of pubic filings (10-Q, 8-K, Forms 3, 4, 5, etc.) for a particular stock (extra both numerical information as well as the language use in each filing) and see how the language changes in each filing relative to how the numbers of each file changes. Then try to find if this data has any relationship with the target underlying stock (i.e. a lead-lag relationship of sorts). That is how you can start doing ""quantamental"" analysis.

The solution above would definitely work for medium-longer term modeling",1642289131.0,3

I would guess you could take many, many instances of companies releasing this info and assume all other factors produce some random noise around the price; then see if you can find a consistent signal pulse at the time of earnings release.

However, it is very possible market understanding changes in a non-random way overtime. Maybe in 1999 every earnings rallied +X% anyways regardless of misses; maybe in 2001 every earnings sold off regardless.

I’m just thinking out loud now, but maybe there is research in signal processing for finding a consistent signal under non-random noise. I’ll Google some and update with any interesting references I find.

8427,altcoin,Jacy looking juicy!,Monster1487,1642564131.0,47,24,0.77,"Thought I would take a stroll down shitcoin alley, its been a while.

I see nothing has changed, one webpage wonder that wont actually do anything useful until phase 4 ? and when is phase 4 ? I mean let's not confuse phases with quarters or was that the intention ? and if you keep going you can always kick that down the road, cant you ? Seen that tons of time and some app that has your webpage and ability to buy and see your balance is not an app. Where it the mock up of that ?

All this work, marketing, signing people up just for an NFT museum ?, in the scheme of things how hard is it to have built an NFT marketplace or have some kind of working model or part of one ?  and hey, I see you pumped and dumped once and its building back up or was that part of build up again ? Anyone who is passionate about something like this would have more than words.

and your contract ? it stunk before I gave it the smell test, better fixit up a little before certik looks at it: [https://tokensniffer.com/token/0x916c5de09cf63f6602d1e1793fb41f6437814a62](https://tokensniffer.com/token/0x916c5de09cf63f6602d1e1793fb41f6437814a62)

The interesting thing is that the new contracts stinks more then the old one:

0x08f2991a6eff2671cf791b82aeae64fbbfdd0633

[https://tokensniffer.com/token/0x08f2991a6eff2671cf791b82aeae64fbbfdd0633](https://tokensniffer.com/token/0x08f2991a6eff2671cf791b82aeae64fbbfdd0633)

I heard that the original pump and dump was caused by rogue developers and now its been taken over, new devs, new contract, new coin etc. Cool Story bro..... no one is doxed so how would anyone know ? Nice reset story, do a  pump and dump then roll out the script, new contract and start over with a nice slow dive this time. 

The interesting thing is that the new contract is full of more rugpull holes then the old one,

So if you fix up the rugpull holes, Certik only audits the security and some possible code flaws but they dont verify what the program does, if its useful, if it actual does something. They passed a shit coin that was the equivalent of a metal cash box with a padlock on it.

Does anyone know what a white paper is anymore ? this has some vague pie in the sky ideas.

Your tokennomics is boilerplate from all the other shitcoins with reflections.

Where is your team doxed ? how about names and linkedin profiles on the webpage ? What have they got to hide ?

Listing on CMC or coingeko means nothing, its no endorsement of anything, tons of shitcoins are listed.

But hey, dont worry, I have written emails like this before because I cared about people new to crypto getting ripped off. But I guess its greed that gets the better of them once they drank the kool-aid.

I would be careful in your response,  I may never come back unless provoked. I poked my head in another shitcoin back in february that managed to kick the can down the road 10 months and it still does nothing and people still believe. But because they jumped all over me, I made it a point of coming back once a month, today is that day, Shall I add you to the list ?",1642619544.0,3

Having worked in VFX myself (as a producer, not an artist), you could improve the following:

\- the light reflections don't  interact with the ground - it's grass on the ground be the reflections are flat - i think you need bump mapping for the surface you render on- similar to the water dropping, when the water elemental is destroyed - it flows on a perfectly flat surface, not on the real ground - again bump mapping- last one for logic: water & fire and lighting should leave marks on the ground where they step - ground stays wet for water, burnt for fire. and for lighting burn marks where the lightning hits

Just my 2 cents - this would be my feedback if it was a shot on a feature I was working on.
