To contributors to this sub, if you've got a great article fantastic. however, provide a synopsis on what its about. I've had to spend many hours explaining this to people when they submit link posts without any context. My goal in doing so is to promote quality discussion, when i see a good post come up on the mod queue. this is important because:

* People are unlikely to read your paper / article / video unless you can give them a TLDR  / synopsis on the subject mater.

* A synopsis sparks discussion about the subject matter, which is one of the things this sub is about

* I''m just reiterating so of what /u/davidvanbeveren, has said where he put it best. However i wanted to post this with my personal touch on the subject matter. 

Personally i feel quality posts are more important than volume. if you want volume that is not vetted, and there are potential concerns that posts / coins are promoted over others, thats for /r/CryptoCurrency or other subs. That doesnt happen here. we don't shill coins and actively prevent people from doing so. We have banned people in the past for doing so.

As an aside, i implore you to read mastering bitcoin. imo its the most fundamental resource to get started understanding blockchain, understanding different consensus protocols etc.

I also think this paper is a must read

[Do you need a blockchain?](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/375.pdf)

I think the paper is a bit biased as being anti blockchain. but thats up to the reader to decide. It looks at the use case of blockchain over centralised solutions. pros / cons etc.

I'm lucky that im a programmer and did cryptography in my studies at university and have 10 years in the industry as a dev, so picking up concepts like hashing, signing etc was quite easy for me. mastering bitcoin is supposedly an easy read for someone without this background but i disagree. 

That said, i am by no means an expert in cryptotechnology, far from it. i learned the most from this sub, and continue to do so. 

i find the tech far more interesting then the investment potential. blockchain is special because it removes a centralised authority from consensus. imagine a decentralised facebook, reddit, youtube etc. no more censorship. these companies are bad actors. extend this to a decentralised internet. this is what i really hope for crypto.",1539084453.0,7

All of these L1s are blockchain that host smart contracts and they're all trying to do three things at once: scale w lots of transactions, be secure, and be decentralized. Any two of these things is easy to achieve, but trying to do all three is extremely difficult.

Ethereum has made the decision to focus on decentralization and security, and move transactions to chains referred to as L2s in order to scale properly. L2s generally derive their security from the L1 chain they post transactions to, so they can continue to be secure but have much greater throughput.

Other L1s have achieved scaling but usually at the cost of decentralization or sometimes security. Ultimately, all L1s will have to face this decision and make their choices.

Eth had to make it first because of how many more transactions they had compared to other chains. High gas fees just means there has been insane demand for blockspace.

It's not exactly a chronic problem, it's more a short term thing that every blockchain will have to face. Eth is way ahead of any other chains in solving these issues.

This is why Hardware Wallets are constructed as they are. A well designed hardware wallet will never, ever send keys out of the wallet to an attached PC. The only option to get the keys out of the device is when the owner specifically requests the backup phrase by interacting with the buttons on the device itself. If you want to make a transaction from the wallet, your wallet SW sends the unsigned transaction to the device and then the user validates it on the screen of the device before sending back the signed transaction, which can now be accepted on the network. The actual private keys never leave the device.

Soft wallets really depend on how much you trust the developers, and the app delivery chain. It's not worth going through all the hassle of a hard wallet for $10 of SHIB. Some developers have been around a while and have reputations to uphold, so it's in their interest to make sure their apps are legit.

Proper software does not store your private key in the first place, so if it gets infiltrated, it will have nothing to report.

It's worth calling out that metamask, to use an example, could probably get your encrypted private key pretty easily.  I'm not intimately familiar with the code.  But if you updated to a new version, it could probably access your encrypted key and phone home immediately.  In that case, they could run a password cracker and probably pop most of the wallets.  I'll be honest, I don't even use a secure password in metamask.

What I do is use a ledger as a hot wallet, assuming that there is some risk that the ledger manufacturers could be corrupted and lying in wait, but the risk is low enough for me to use.

There's only one SHA256 hash function. Bitcoin uses double-SHA256 as hash function in the Hashcash Proof-of-Work algorithm \[1\].

So hash output = SHA256(SHA256(input)), where input is the 80-byte header.

A Hashcash puzzle is solved when the hash output is below some target threshold that's computed for each block. This is much more fine-grained than number of leading 0s.

A miner keeps computing the hash on different inputs (by making small changes to the header) until they get a hash output below the target threshold, or until they see someone else solve the puzzle for this block height first.

If I understood correctly, restoring involves generating the root account, then deriving child addresses until (the wallet) generates a child with no transactions and no balance—then it stops. 

So to your example: Metamask would recover all four addresses if they were used. Otherwise it would only recover the first—even though you can still get the other children later (i.e. accounts 2 and 3 will have the same addresses and private/public keys as the first time they were generated.

The biggest change (from a user perspective) might be _identity_. Instead of signing in with your email or Google or FB or whatever, users can identify themselves by their wallet.

It's very clumsy right now. It can be done, with MetaMask, but I call it clumsy because it requires installing a Chrome extension or a separate mobile app etc.

This will change, very dramatically, once mainstream browsers and iOS/Android natively start shipping with crypto wallets.

Now, once you have identity, the next layer on top of it is payments. So micropayments, for example, might finally become a reality. Because the same wallet that one uses to identify oneself can now also be used to pay in a friction less manner.

Then you start adding other layers. Like the entire meta verse thing. Your wallet holds the NFTs and other digital assets.

Overall, we're both very near and yet far from this becoming mainstream. There are some things that need a lot of improving, especially key management. Things might turn out quite different than what we expect, e.g. custodial wallets might win.

Those are typically political in nature and what's political typically tends to be disposed to opinion.

Let think about this from a few perspectives.

If the implemented blockchain is decentralized, then it will be immutable. There are situations where you can have a centralized blockchain; An example of this being a CBDC.

The IPFS protocol is mutable as well as distributed. It would be difficult to take a app or it's content down, but not impossible.

The question really boils down to, ""Is censorship ethical?"". As the usual, the answer is, ""It depends."". Let's reframe this line of thinking. Let's instead ask 3 questions. ""Should censorship be allowed?"", ""Should censorship be disallowed?"", and ""Should some censorship be allowed?"".

The U.S. First Amendment went to great lengths to protect Free Speech. It's so well protected that advocates of cryptography used it to protect their code by printing that code onto shirts and then wearing those shirts while stating it was Free Speech... And it worked.

So, let's take a step back and ask the same question by rephrasing it. ""Should Free Speech be allowed?"", ""Should Free Speech be disallowed?"", and ""Should some Free Speech be allowed?"".

This is to illustrate a conundrum. In most judicial cases in the U.S., Free Speech tends to win out. Explicit exceptions to these disputes are typically private and some cases even bleed out into the public.

As far as I can tell, there is a considerable amount of censorship.

To censor is

One more thing I'll add. This is perhaps a misleading conclusion that you've reached. It is better to think of Ethereum is a distributed AWS than as a distributed database. It is also a database yes, but that maybe gives it too much of a static connotation. It's quite a bit more dynamic than that, so thinking of it like a compute layer is maybe a more helpful metaphor. It is the substrate in which things happen. It has a current state (which is where your database metaphor is correct), but the compute layer is completely general. So you can use it to do computations that only emit events, never writing anything to the state. In fact, that's a common pattern (since emitting events is much cheaper than storing state in Ethereum itself).

It's not only a contract. The DAO was mindful of these issues, especially in the future. Avoiding future name collisions and conflicts with DNS were addressed prior to going live. 

.ETH has full DNS namespace integration. This is the reason anyone with a .com address can integrate it to ENS and receive up to 40 different cryptos to their .com domain. Only ENS names have this functionality (as far as I know). 

Ironically, you've identified an issue other decentralized name services may encounter in the future. The fact that they sell these domains without telling buyers is unethical, IMO.

For example, .SOL addresses don't enjoy global namespace recognition. If this crypto-sector explodes (and I'm betting it will), problems will emerge even if they win. DNS dTLD round UD may win the rights to suffixes, but not for the high value ones. 

Sellers are taking advantage of less experienced buyers. Brantly, the guy previously in control of the ENS DAO,[brought this to everyone's attention](https://i.imgur.com/SrybrCG.png). I encourage you to see his thread on this subject. People buying those domains are in for quite a rug pull. 

It's also important to consider the quality of the projects that support these products. You'll never see unstoppable, .crypto, or .sol [do something like this.](https://i.imgur.com/xiA10wY.png) 

The ENS DAO constituation carries a provision that keeps the opton open as to how to distribute profits that stem from continued sells of ENS names.

As far as I'm understood, the DNS is simply a server which stores a domain name of abc.com to an address in the internet. It's basically an identifying string and thus they are unique.

So anyone who wants to resolve abc.com would have to reach out to the server and get the corresponding address of this domain.

But, they are only unique within the DNS system. What stops another person deploying the same program and now allow people to register with his DNS server under the same **.com** domains? The only thing that needs to be changed is just getting apps to use a different DNS server to resolve the domain and that's all, isn't it?

Since it is account's based, you only need to keep the state of everyone's accounts, i.e. how many Algo they have + their token amounts. In Algorand, the wallet itself needs to have 0.1 Algo to be active, and then 0.1 Algo per token. So you cannot simply add tokens, you need to ""opt into"" them by locking up 0.1 Algo.

These simple nodes, aka participation nodes, also store the smart contract space (also requiring locking up some Algo) and the last 1000 blocks.

You could imagine a scenario where there are only two accounts, endlessly sending transactions to each other. In this scenario, the blockchain would just grow endlessly, until they've exhausted their wealth in transaction fees. However! The storage space would be a fixed thing - account A's net worth + account B's net worth.

The next question is then, as time goes on, won't catch up take longer and longer time? For that they've developed some tools called state proofs or [compact certificates](https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/papers/micali-compactcert.pdf) and a system called [Vault](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/269). The point is to get enough of the blockchain stake to sign off on a particular state of the blockchain at a certain block height, and use that to convince new nodes that it is correct so they can jump to that point.

Nodes can of course choose to run as full *index* nodes, in order to offer transaction history as a service to others, e.g. if someone wants to know how a certain NFT has been moved about between accounts.

until exchanges/wallets hit limits they didn't even bother batching outputs, now they do that's scaling factor of up to \~80x for same space

softfork for CISA, or cross input signature aggregation, is one of the most popular goals to aggregate signatures across inputs as well which would also mean enormous space savings. signatures are the majority of the transaction size so its enormous if 100s can be reduced to 1

within same input, with taproot soft fork that came with schnorr sigs you can already aggregate unlimited # of signatures into just 1 for like a multisig or treshhold multisig, that's an enormous scaling factor for same block space. AND has privacy benefits as outsiders have no idea if 1 or million sigs were used. CISA is hope to do that across many inputs and ideally non-interactively if possible

segwit also put in discount on data stored outside of utxo set (derived state) basically motivating people to put data where nodes won't have to keep it in memory as part of state through financial incentives. for example scripts go into script sig which isn't part of utxo set, only hash of scripts is stored there. so instead of using multisig script in output where you have to show 3 public keys and nodes have to keep it around you only have 1 hash, and multisig keys can go into script sig which is just part of blocks, not utxo set, for discount. so while block size was technically increased once by moving script sig data out of blocks, it also had utxo set size  benefits to help nodes out

before taproot you would have to provide the entire script used as part of script sig to show that it matches the hash provided and you had size limits and operation number limits depending on p2sh or p2wsh. this made longer scripts more expensive. taproot allows you to use up to infinitely long script by just revealing the parts of script you use within if/then path chosen + merkle proof. that's once again enormous increase in efficiency for existing block space AND privacy as rest of script doesn't have to be made public.

and layer 2 concepts like lightning and even paypools are a way to secure up to infinite layer 2 transactions with a single on-chain transaction and multiple smart contract based transactions passed around off-chain  until necessary to put on chain, if ever. as good as that is already, taproot and schnorr are further greatly reducing even their impact on blockchain space by reducing size of scripts/sigs necessary.

as you can see there are many ways to increase growth of throughput without increasing rate of growth of blockchain

however if deemed necessary for unknown to me yet reasons it can still be increased linearly through things such as drivechains, extension blocks, lower block times via soft forks but its harder to convince people to accept higher costs for same degree of throughput increase than to improve efficiency of every byte of blockspace we already have many orders of magnitude. some things that small throughput lets us do is sync blockchain through radio mesh networks, satellites, and similar low bandwidth methods that help break our dependence on the internet lines.

rgb seals design allows confirmation of countless token transfers that used to take separate tx on Bitcoin with omni or counterparty layers with a single on-chain transaction by also doing merkle root type commits

it's also possible to replace burning energy/cost with burning bitcoin to recycle bitcoin permissionless pow nature to create artificial permissionless unforgeable costliness for other blockchains without additional pow or bitcoin nodes having to validate them or store them, just those that choose to do have to.

Hands down, the absolute best real Web 3 use case is the decentralized internet that [Skynet Labs](https://github.com/SkynetLabs) has built. Skynet is not only a working real world use case of crypto technology, but it also abstracts away the complexity of using crypto from the developers and end users.

For example, in order for a web developer to begin developing on Skynet, all they need to do is upload their application or website folder containing their `index.html` file to [Skynet](https://siasky.net) and their web application or website is immediately available online. By simply dragging and dropping a folder into a web page they have made their entire application or website completely decentralized and secure with blockchain technology.

DAOs and DeFi already have good use cases and don't really need further explanation. They're also not what OP is asking about.

OP is asking more about the NFT and identity part.

The thing about NFTs is that they're just numbers stored on ledgers. They're typically very small to save space and don't store the actual customer data. The ledgers themselves only store transactions for those NFTs. It's up to platforms to determine how they're actually interpreted. Your web3 avatar on one platform might look very different than your avatar on another database unless there's a centralized database that stores a single interpretation of your NFT or avatar.

The biggest issue will be cross-platform compatibility. If your assets and NFTs are stored across a dozen different DLTs, each platform you use will need to have separate cross-platform interoperability with that DLT. If one platform decides not to support the DLT network that records your NFT, you're out of luck for that network.

So what does Web3 provide that Web2 doesn't? More open IdP/SSO APIs. Instead of using Google, MS AD/Azure, and Okta for your SSO Identity Provider, you'll be using Web3 stored on some DLT instead of in a centralized database.

It's not just about cryptocurrency or blockchain tech. Thats just a smaller part of the bigger picture at hand. 

It's mostly about accessibility and availability at a level playing field. There are crypto projects like [lbry / odyssey](https://odysee.com/) and [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) that aim at the storage issue with a distributed p2p web. 

I've looked into the IPFS docs for devs and it supports mostly the shell, go, and Javascript for now (personally, I'm a python programmer, but I can work with JS). I use self hosted IPFS node through a browser plugin (it comes with brave by default) and a surprising amount of the web just suddenly opens up. so far, it's still early stages, and I can't wait to see what comes out of it; the good, the bad, and the ugly. otherwise, it wouldn't be so interesting.

You can already build your own distributed web app and there aren't a lot of resources on it available just yet, but there are plenty of existing projects that showcase what is possible with it.

It's purpose is to re-structure the systems we use to live & work. The reason many people don't see it's practical application is because we've conformed to the present state of affairs which have always governed our lives.

Here's a quick example. Identity. If you lose your ID and for whatever reason your government refuses to grant you a new one, you're no longer a legal person. Can you imagine living your life without government identification. We consider that normal, but in fact it's shameful. Web 3 returns that to you as it should be.

The current system grants banks enormous power over our lives. Under this system, a large percentage of the world populatio is essentially locked out. Consequently, what they can achieve is limited. Crypto & web 3 deepen the monetary channels and get to more people.

Right now, every company on various levels acts as a data aggregator. They monitize it and sell it to the highest bidder. Do you see a dime of it?

Web 3 is soon to revolutionize the insurance industry. I worked in the insurance industry for 15 years and can tell you that 80% of the work (admin, actuarial, most of the claims handling) can be coded and even run on DeFi.

With Web 3, when you're at the grocery store, you'll use your phone to verify that produce, meats, or any other products are what they say they are or are as fresh as they say they are.

I live in Southern California. When I drive through San Pedro in LA County, the ocean looks like a parking lot because of the container boats. It's a fucking disaster. Web 3 w/blockchain technology is a perfect records, storage, and management system that the legacy systems.

But what's more important than any of this is what ideas and applications people will invent when they have access to these technologies. The emergance of DAO's is going to be disruptful. ENS is going to be a monster because its DNS integration means it may become the face of crypto. It's going to be exciting that's for sure.

For one, web2 can't signify ownership of any digital item that works in a widely accepted system. All their system are proprietary to each other. You buy a game in Steam, it doesn't work in Origin/Epic. You buy a movie in Google, it doesn't work in Playstation. You have a Paypal account? Well actually you are borrowing an account from PayPal on PayPal's terms and your account can be frozen for reasons they deem necessary. Twitter/FB account? Even the president of the usa can be deplatformed lol.

>Users can get paid for ad revenue instead of companies like Google/Facebook

The revenue model no longer just relies on ads. Web3 relies more on the ""substack/patreon"" model where you get to interact directly with your consumers. As great as substack/patreon is, they are still beholden to the fiat payment rail. This means it takes a while to transfer, settlements are not instant etc.

I think if you still have this question, you're not fully understanding what crypto stack brings to the table, Among other things, the crypto stack brings (among other things):

* native ownership, which means the way the NFT/ownership is communicated is within the blockchain itself so it inherits all the security properties of the blockchain. 
* censor resistance, as you own your assets on the blockchain, you are free to do any activity in any platform and any constraints that you see fit.
* p2p with no third party due to consensus protocol, so this means instant settlement, programmable conditions, etc
* code/law certainty, this means the platform you are using will give the same functions without the community consensus to change. case in point: Twitter API, one day Twitter just discontinues it and it stops many products/startup in its tracks. FB the same way etc.

The trade off for all of these are also numerous, one of them is the currently high gas fees which means a bit of a fragmented existence of many viable blockchains (BTC, ETH, SOL, AVAX, etc) however these drawbacks are also opportunities that is being worked on.

Imagine Internet right now, and you would be surprised that there are takes like these:

""by 2005, it would become clear that the Internet's effect on the economy is no greater than the fax machines.""

**Composability** kicks ass - Open Banking spurred fintech innovation in the UK (consumer ux improved). In Web3, it's on a grander scale - I just don't think the Web2-equivalent Web3 apps are here yet to connect it all. I'd liken Web3 to how WeChat *feels* \- what was once a messaging app now allows you to order lunch, book a flight and transmit money around...all within the app with one user profile.

**Finance** \- If we moved from banks offering loans to centralised peer-to-peer loan entities (LendInvest, FundingCircle, Zopa) - is it possible to eventually take out a mortgage from decentralised liquidity pools (zk proofs for affordability, land registry interaction as NFTs etc.)? 

**DAO** \- If some folk can raise $47m for an original copy of the US constitution, surely it's possible to raise funds to build out a Web3 app like Reddit? No idea on the ideal tokenomics design but *again*, scattered thoughts:   
\- The token governs development  
\- Token staking allows interaction e.g. commenting or creating subreddits (to prevent spammers and bad actors?)  
\- Token acts as payment e.g. to donate or purchase a user's art/music/work (no TradFi connection required, offramp via DEX if desired)  
\- A sustainable revenue loop model, via interest from a treasury allocation, to keep operations running for the community

To begin actually using Skynet as a user however, [Homescreen](https://homescreen.hns.siasky.net) is where you want to start. To begin click the ""Authenticate with MySky"" button in the top right. A popup window will appear with the option to ""Sign Up"" at the bottom. Once you have clicked ""Sign Up"" a MySky account will be created for you, and you will be given a 15 word seed phrase. This seed phrase is now your password to \*\*everything\*\* you accesses on Skynet. So make sure to write down you seed phrase and store it in a safe location. It would also be helpful to sign up for a password manager like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) so you can securely access your MySky seed from any device. Once you have stored your seed in a safe place, you can click ""Sign Up"" to complete your account creation. Once completed you will then see your Homescreen with a couple apps preinstalled for you and you can begin using Skynet as it was intended to be.

**Note:** *If anyone would like to avoid creating their own MySky and want to try the account I set up writing this, feel free to use the seed* `went wanted height boil axes mailed riots waffle mural mumble rising also ahead gables reef`

To start I would suggest adding [SkyOS](https://homescreen.hns.siasky.net/#/skylink/AQDeIfL5Ghk5PqyFDJIhQQHBb8l56IKNxm_m3XScrPRTLQ) which is a completely decentralized operating system for all of your web3 apps. Once installed click the SkyOS icon to launch into your new OS which can also be accessed directly from [https://sky-os.hns.siasky.net](https://sky-os.hns.siasky.net). Sign in to SkyOS using your MySky seed and grant it access to your MySky. Once loaded you can begin exploring your new SkyOS. To launch your preinstalled apps use the top left hand menu button and to access your SkyOS settings like your profile, OS themes and widgets, click your username in the top right corner.

Once you have finished exploring SkyOS, lets manually add a new app to your Homescreen. To do so click your username in the top right corner and select ""Homescreen"" from the drop down. You'll notice that Homescreen currently has a bug which makes the background transparent so for the moment try to ignore that 😅. Once your Homescreen has loaded lets add a decentralized chat similar to Discord. To do so type ""chatbubble"" into the search bar above and hit enter. Once installed you can exit out of your Homescreen and return to your SkyOS. Before launching a new application make sure to quickly refresh your SkyOS window to force an update of the app menu. Once you've done that you can now access SkyChat from your app menu.",1637996122.0,6

Now lets talk about how these apps give you the benefits you are curious about. As you already know, your MySky account is secured using a seed phrase and blockchain encryption. What MySky essentially does is gives you a private place on the Skynet network which all of your user data is stored. All of your videos, images, chats, comments, likes, etc. It all get stored on your MySky. When you log in to a new application or website on Skynet, you are prompted with a permission dialog. This is because every application or website on Skynet must ask the user for permission to access the required data needed. Because of this the you now has the ability to revoke access to your MySky data at any time and effectively gives the you complete control over your personal data. MySky can also be view to act as your universal login similar to ""Sign in with Google"". The difference being that unlike ""Sign in with Google"", the account you are signing in with is yours and only yours. This means you no longer need to worry about losing access to an account because of a deactivated or lost email.

As for monetization on Skynet that is the the next thing to be implemented and the whitepaper is expected to drop sometime next month. What monetization will do is effectively [make everything on Skynet into an NFT](https://2002k4if50e0m3kgq6h0af3gp5e2ivunl3eag9jsmu16gq47pomg6g8.siasky.net/) which can be monetized by the creator. Every app, website, video, image, and even comments, can be monetized. This means that every time a new user load or views content on Skynet, the creators are getting paid behind the scenes by the user ""purchasing"" the content they are viewing. This itself is another very lengthy topic so I will not discuss it here lol. But this is the gist of how monetization is expected to work.

[https://sushi.com/](https://sushi.com/)

So you come with your crypto, let's say ETH and you connect your wallet there. In there you participate in one of the ways you can do DeFi, provide liquidity pair. So you like GRT, so you want to provide ETH/GRT pair. You swap in Sushi swap, and once you have a 1:1 ratio of the ETH/GRT you want to provide you commit them to Sushi swap.

How you make money by doing this is that the next time another user wants to swap from ETH to GRT or vice versa, you get let's say 0.25% of the transaction on top of the incentive that SushiSwap offers when you commit this liquidity pair. The way SushiSwap makes money is from all the financial activity from their user, including lending/borrowing assets etc and also pocketing some trading fee from the users as well that they share with you (if you provide the relevant liquidity pair).

So we don't have any data privacy that is going to be sold to a third party, because how SushiSwap and user can get value is from the activity of doing the DeFi itself. In web3 products, they are not hellbent on getting your personal data because that's not how they will make money.

I do. Just like ""fuck overpriced taxis"" were enough to get many people to move to Uber and Lyft, and ""fuck surveillance"" was enough to get many people to move to Bitcoin and Monero. I think getting _everybody_ will take time, but I personally am moving away from big tech services, and I think as alternatives mature, more people will move as well.

I do agree that in some cases centralization will probably always be more efficient. But it's hard to tell just _how_ much more efficient, because Web 3.0 is so new. I think give it a few more years and we'll see how fast Web 3.0 can really get. Because after a certain point, performance actually doesn't matter as much anymore. If a website loads in 0.3 seconds versus 0.35, I probably won't notice. And when the differences in performance are that small, other things become more important. Like flexibility and privacy and interoperability. For example, the iPad Pro is probably the fastest tablet out there. Yet I still wouldn't prefer one because other tablets are fast enough, and less locked down. And I know there are plenty others like me.

As for a concrete example of a Web 3.0 application, [there's a list of them here](https://github.com/ipfs/awesome-ipfs#apps). One of the apps listed there is [d.tube](https://d.tube), which is a video platform like Youtube but [uses IPFS for storage and Avalon blockchain for the database](https://d.tube/#!/wiki/faq/how-does-dtube-work).

Bitcoin/Monero have very real use cases: anonymised wealth holdings and transfers. Tax evasion, black markets, crypto _currency_ has made these things a whole lot easier. Bitcoin was _immediately_ useful — you didn’t even have to imagine or adopt hyperbolic language, like we’re seeing with Web3 tech.

Web3 technologies are improving but there’s no way around established laws of distributed computing. It will always be more expensive and less performant to operate on the blockchain, unless there’s some high cost associated with a “trust-ful” model. In the case of black markets and tax evasion, “trust-ful” models(trusting the bank and Visa, etc.) has a huge, _huge_ cost: real probability of imprisonment. When it comes to watching TikTok videos, “trust-ful” doesn’t really have that much of a negative cost. Making TikTok trust-less would just be a huge waste of computing resources, and no one’s going to foot the bill for it.

To complete it, the miners must find the nonce or random number to ensure a consolidated input of nonce, transaction merkle tree, and block name all have an output padded with 0's from the SHA-256 algorithm.

You can see the stagnation is correlated with the ""bear market"" periods where use of the network, and the exponential behavior during the ""bull market"" periods. 

We will see the effect of the lightning network, but if the mining is based on price, which is in turn based on adoption and network usage, then it shouldn't matter, it anything, it should increase the energy consumption since it will make it easier to get people on the network.

Regarding hashrate, which is a closer indicator of difficulty and energy consumption, has been increasing quadratically, if not exponentially since the network started picking up steam in 2015-2016. The energy consumption might be offset by more efficient mining technology that would provide more hashrate for the same amount of energy, but eventually the network difficulty and energy consumption catches up with the hashrate.

The program could also offer the incumbent utility incentives for the distribution and transmission upgrades required to integrate the generator, as well.

The value of the network is proportional to the square of the number of users on the network per Metcalfe's law, thus the price of bitcoin goes up with adoption.

As you noted, the increased hashrate results in an upward difficulty adjustment, which will negatively impact miner profitability, which will cause the least profitable to stop mining until the economics swing back in their favour.

* Cost of mining: energy cost, ASIC cost
* Block rewards and halvings; every time the block reward drops, so does the hash rate
* The fact that Bitcoin transaction transaction costs are currently an insignificantly-small portion of the total rewards to the point that they don't matter. Bitcoin is constantly running a backlog with a large mempool, so it can't process any faster.

So glad to be writing the corny title for the first time. We love it!

#1 - SUBREDDIT CHANGES  

One of the big news items for the subreddit was the temporary blacklist applied to Loopring - I'll go in to this in more detail in the Manipulation section, but I wanted to state this isn't the first project to be temporarily blacklisted for rule-breaking around vote manipulation and brigading.

As usual, the simpler questions have been directed towards the Daily Discussion threads, as well as some perspective, speculation and anecdotal posts - do you feel this has materially improved the diversity of the Daily Discussion and reduced the quantity of repetitive comments? Please let us know.

Something many of you will have noticed is that we are creeping up on 4 Million users! At time of writing we are just 13 thousand users away, which will be here in the next couple of days. Stay tuned for some special surprises once the threshold is breached!

#2 - AMA's  

We try and regularly get the wider Crypto community to get involved in the subreddit and this last month saw 5 official AMA's - We've compiled them for you.  

[1. Safeseed returned on Nov 13 to do another giveaway of their metal stamping kits and some MOONs and discuss the importance of wallet seed backups](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qt0t2x/safe_seed_5oz_silver_bar_stamp_kit_molybdenum/)

[2. On Nov 16 the lead devs of Syscoin came on to talk about how Syscoin tries to leverage Bitcoin's proven security and Ethereum's Turing-complete programmability elevated to true L2 scalability via ZK-Rollups](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qv1cgq/join_the_revolution_syscoin_is_the_best_of/)

[3. The folks from OASIS protocol joined us on Nov 17 to discuss how their privacy-enabled, layer-1 blockchain network with its high throughput, low gas fees and secure architecture, is able to power scalable DeFi, revolutionizing Open Finance and expanding it beyond traders and early adopters to a mass market](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qvyw0n/we_are_oasis_the_leading_privacyenabled_layer1/)

[4. Coinsmart, an exchange that recently went public, came by on Nov 22 to talk about becoming a publicly traded company in Canada, adding new assets, and onboarding new users](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qzounr/im_justin_hartzman_ceo_of_coinsmart_a_crypto/)

[5. US Senate Candidate Morgan Harper dropped in on Nov 23 to discuss her campaign in Ohio and the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r0r0k8/ama_on_rcryptocurrency_is_live_8pm_et_im_morgan/ )

#3 - MANIPULATION  

It's not just Moons that are the objective for Manipulation, but often a desire to see a certain narrative or inflated popularity pushed. We realise that some of you have made financial decisions based off advice in this subreddit - at least to some capacity. And therefore it's important that we try and keep discussions natural. If something is popular - then it's popular!

However, we have very strict rules around brigading. Brigading is simply defined as encouraging users from outside the subreddit to enter and disrupt the normal flow of information. As most of you are aware, part-way through the month, the subreddit was swamped with Loopring commenters directed to our subreddit via brigading.

While being directed to the subreddit isn't an abnormal occurrence and we deal with these using individual bans and post removals, the scale of Loopring's brigading was quite unlike anything we've seen so far. As a result, we reached out to moderators on the Loopring subreddit and discord with a request to limit this behaviour. Unfortunately, the requests were not adequately implemented in time and to preserve the integrity of the Cryptocurrency subreddit, Loopring was placed on a temporary blacklist.  

Thankfully we have been in contact with moderators of Loopring social media channels and are working together to prevent further brigading.


#4 - THE HIGHLIGHT  

This is by no means an official badge of endorsement, but every month we will pick what we feel like is a well-written and informative post and plop it here for some extra attention. u/rithpath has made a great little tool that scrapes Reddit looking for mentions of particular Cryptocurrencies. This tool can be used to measure social media sentiment and comes at just the right time as the dawn of discovery of the meme token is upon us. It's also useful for determining a site-wide sentiment, or just the bubbling noise of a few individuals.  

Good job Rithpath! For your excellent post, 1,000 moons will shortly reach your Reddit Vault!

[We spent days building a scraper for cryptocurrency mentions across Reddit in order to find trending coins. Then we put it on a website so everyone can have access! ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qqfjgn/we_spent_days_building_a_scraper_for/)

If you are willing to buy/hand out food/goods for the homeless and get reimbursed for the cost of food/goods in crypto, dm me or reply here! Do not hesitate - there is absolutely no catch and we have many redditors who can vouch for the project!

I won't link the urls to reduce spam, but you can easily google the name crypto for the homeless to check out our blog/site/socials.

Tax laws vary between countries, so you may get more helpful replies if you specify the place you are asking about.

Please note that Rule #4 does not allow for Tax Evasion.  This is [a site wide rule](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) and [a subreddit rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/rules/).  Do not endorse, suggest, advocate, instruct others, or ask for help with tax evasion.  Do not be coy and sarcastically recommend against it or suggest using a privacy coin in response to an IRS inquiry.

Note:  Tax discussion is allowed as long as the above rules are not violated.

It's a fact that they go after the common class and ignore the rich because they can defend themselves with money. We're already in this situation where being rich you only get richer and being poor, you're only getting poorer. As the lower class you have to deal with getting less and less value from your pay every time the inflation increases, whereas the rich can even avoid taxes without anyone coming after them. What do you expect? People let things get to this point by undervaluing themselves like idiots, and acception that whatever the government does is fine. Just look at what age you have to retire compared to what age politicians may retire.

The government won't do anything as long as people accept those things. And why would they? They're only becoming richer, so everything works out for them. Meanwhile, you can't even voice your opinion.

People will jump at you and shut you up saying you know nothing, not then realizing that they're hurting themselves too with that ignorance. From my experience, this will likely get downvoted. People don't like hearing the truth, but whatever. I'm starting to not care anymore about all this political crap, and likely many other are starting to feel the same when they get the same experience. The rich are getting what they wanted and the poor masses of sheeps are getting what they're accepting.

You're failing to recognize the impact of ""*institutional capture""*, or phrased another way, the ability of major institutions to capture and control the Crypto market in ways beyond your perception. Much like how stocks are held mostly by a small portion of the population, ""Crypto whales"" exist as well, having the ability to single-handedly impact crypto prices over night.

Decentralization makes sense, but only if there is adoption. Crypto's biggest problem is that it is so fractured. Imagine the hellscape that would become the world if every industry and market on Earth used different currencies. Want to buy dairy products? You'll need to swap for COWCoin. Need your car fixed? You'll need to swap for AUTO coin. AUTO holders not interested in COWCoin? Whelp, guess you'll need to ""wash"" your currency via swaps with trading fees. I'm all for decentralizing away **from a national currency**, but I'm also extremely aware of the nightmare that is **fractured currency**. If you're not sure what that looks like, go download a mobile game. See how much you enjoy having to wield 14 different types of tokens to advance/progress.

While the blockchain ledger provides some degree of transparency, transparency doesn't prevent scamming of any kind. Google ""Crypto scammers"" and see all the evidence you need. You can track wallets, you can track transactions, you can track transfers, but there are even LESS means of regulatory enforcement in Crypto than there are in Finance.

https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/five-years-later-panama-papers-still-having-a-big-impact/

>In just the past month alone, more than 300 news articles in 14 languages referenced the Panama Papers as authorities continue to pursue investigations and push for reforms, a search of the Nexis news database shows.

https://www.digitalnewsreport.org/publications/2019/gauging-global-impacts-panama-papers-three-years-later/

The most reliable outcome of Panama Papers reporting around the world has been various forms of official deliberation and information-gathering, observed in 45 percent of countries tracked in this study.
Nearly a fifth of countries tracked have seen at least one instance of concrete reform, such as a new law or policy designed to address problems exposed in the reporting. This is a higher rate than has been found in comparable analyses, due in part to the global scope of the Panama Papers and the nature of the institutions implicated.
Various tax enforcement measures have been a regular outcome of the reporting, and numerous companies and individuals have been penalised or prosecuted as a result. Direct accountability for public officials remains rare, with officials losing office in fewer than 10 percent of countries tracked.
Backlash against journalists was recorded almost as often as substantive reforms, though in different parts of the world: predictably, reporters have come under threat in countries that score low in press freedom.",1638320366.0,2

Frankly the wealthy in the US probably have domestic companies that offer these services. Or use ones that the ICIJ couldn’t get files from.

Also the US isn’t absent from the papers, just not the featured star. I’m convinced this common assumption is misinformation being spread to absolve the US of its role in the papers.

Spoiler: nothing.

The bigger chunk you own, the more control you have. This is already evident by what happens whenever those whales sell - everybody in the market feels it. Like seriously, I don't understand how people don't understand that either or even ask that question. We see it every single day on every single coin. It's literally how math works.

Crypto tech is pretty much overrated (compare it to how far real tech has come along since 2013: AI, self-driving cars, graphics, robots/drones, phones, etc.). What are the groundbreaking crypto techs? A bridge? Dexes? Boston Dynamics does exponentially more with exponentially less funding than some of these blockchains get.

It's not about the tech: ask any programming language subreddit about it or better yet do a search for ""blockchain"" in r/programming to see professional software engineers demolish blockchain tech as a whole. Literally, try and find 10 arguments won against a professional software engineer about why their coin is better than any other or even why blockchain tech is better than SQL databases that are nearly 50 years old. You won't find 10 won-arguments over the course of 10 years - for all of crypto.

At the end of the day, it's all a casino and if they wanted to, they can absolutely control everything. Again, who's to say they don't already either? They add and get stronger every single massive dump. If you're in this market you're basically going to try and capitalize during the openings they make the market go up.",1638292295.0,1

You won't find 10 won-arguments over the course of 10 years - for all of crypto.

As a professional software engineer, most engineers who haven't specifically studied blockchain technology are surprisingly ignorant about it, like almost as ignorant as the average technically-inclined person. The biggest difference between them and a normal person is that their status as a software engineer makes them feel like they have license to talk about it as if they understand it.

I usually find it pretty easy to win arguments about blockchain technology with other software engineers, because 90% of them don't understand how it works beyond the idea that it's a linked list that's appended to via proof of work. They are usually stuck on the Bitcoin model, with zero idea of what actually goes on on a smart contract chain. They often have significant misconceptions about Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, and cannot explain simple concepts like DeFi lending markets, token governance, or contract or token composability.

Seriously, ask 10 software engineers to publish a ""hello world"" contract on Ethereum. 1 out of 10 would be able to explain how it basically works from start to finish without looking up a tutorial (how to get eth, how to publish the contract, how to invoke the hello world function, how does your client hand that transaction over to the blockchain and how does the blockchain come to consensus on the fact that you've invoked the function).",1638294148.0,4

So you deposit two good coins, ETH and Matic. You earn from traders who just arbitrage the CEX, and this is sustainable as there will always be volume. Now with UNI V3, setting your range can drastically increase your APR, but will quickly just liquidate you into the other coin, which just means you lost that opportunity if the other coin keeps pumping cause now you don't hold it.

Another way of looking at impermanent loss is as one coin pumps it automatically sells high and slowly buys the other coin for you, it's basically DCAing into the other coin, then if it flips you DCA back into the other coin but keep earning those sweet LP fees.

So far my experience with Uniswap has earned me more than I thought with very high APRs.",1638342247.0,1

For example, they sell the token at $1,000 but the intrinsic value is just $100.

If you assume that the protocol just stops operating and getting revenue. Because of inflation, the premium price of $1000 is designed to always go down to the $100. They offset this by the rewards, which could, for example, yield worth $900 over say 300 days. 

Of course, that’s assuming it stops generating revenue. If it continues to generate revenue either from newcomers and selling bonds, then the intrinsic value should rise over time and the premium price will hold some ground. Combine that with the reward your getting over time and the notion of compounding and users will start to think in long term time horizons instead of making a quick buck and bouncing. 

It undeniably leverages ponzi mechanics and benefits long-term participants the most but realistically almost everything finance related—from Bitcoin to fiat—has ponzi mechanics. What differentiates ponzis as good or bad schemes is the utility of the end product.

Long story short, it's better to bond if the bond discount ROI is greater than the 5 day staking ROI. There's been a lot of OHM forks coming out for the last few months. They sprint out of the gate with high bond discounts to incentivize people to bond and add assets to their treasury. 

Usually the first few days after release, the OHM forks will dump so I wait a few days for them to bottom out before jumping in. I'll usually get one, two, or three 5-day bonds (5,10, or 15 days) before rotating the profits back out. Eventually the bonds/staking APY will lower and after 10-15-20 days, so I try to front run it and jump out. 

I just bridge back and forth between AVAX, BNB, FTM, and MATIC chains. I'm also in one in the SOL ecosystem but it's kind of a bitch to bridge back and forth from SOL, so I just play around with that money in there. I don't mess with ETH because of the gas fees. 

I've got 80% of my OHM fork money in TIME since it's reputable, stable, and has a really solid community and dev. The bond discounts in TIME never really touch the staking APY, so I just leave it to stake. Set and forget. The other 20% of my OHM fork money I use to bond hunt in micro-cap OHM forks. Some of the ones I've done in the past are Snowbank (AVAX), HEC (FTM), SPA (FTM), IN (SOL - kind of shitty bonds), and JADE now (BNB). For example, I just grabbed a 45% 5-day-ROI bond on JADE two days ago. I also claim and stake the rewards every 8 hours so I get an additional ~5-10% within those 5 days, on top of the 45%. 

Here's JADE protocol on Binance:  https://jadeprotocol.io/  The bond discounts are at 35% at the moment. They got some weird thing happening in 16 days with the timer and I don't want no part of that, so I'll probably grab two more 5-day bonds and dip out.

I personally stumbled upon DeFi Chain and it's on ramp service Cake Defi (CeFi & for profit, making access to DeFi Chain easier but for a small fee). 

I put in some money as an experiment as their rates are slightly higher and the projects *for now* looks sustainable. Decentralised stocks are being implemented as I write this, and afaik, that's the first time this is really possible (correct me if I'm wrong!). Binance tried this but they got some regulatory issues with that, that's why they had to stop (due to it not being completely decentralised). 

I'm seriously curious how this will play out, because, in theory, nobody can shut down DeFi Chain as it is completely decentralised (like Anchor) + build on the BTC protocol.

Back in August everyone expected either price to double overnight or dump in a ""sell the news"" event. Instead it went up a bit and didn't dip significantly. Then people got bored and now the effects are being felt the same way bitcoin halvings are never priced in ahead of time and take a 2-3 months to really be reflected in the price. 

There's 1 million ETH that got burned that would have otherwise gone to miners and would be circulated on the market right now. Still a net issuance of ~400k ETH since August, but that's better than 1.4M.

Now imagine after the merge is done and there's no more miners, 0 new ETH making its way to the market (staking withdrawals wont be immediately enabled) *and* ETH continues burning at today's pace. No one has any idea about what this supply crunch will be like, but it won't be overnight either. Expect people to get underwhelmed in the weeks immediately following the merge, and then an immense amount of FOMO 2-3 months later when ETH starts *actually* outperforming BTC to 70%, 75%, 80% of its marketcap (currently at 52%!)

3204,CryptoCurrency,Sells Walls: You know know what these are and how to spot them.,LeSeanMcoy,1638329659.0,57,124,0.92,"Nice post, OP!

There's also a great way to see how much money is needed, on each exchange, to move the price (break sell/buy walls)

Coinmarketcap or Coingecko have this feature, under ""Markets"". You can see BTC here:

[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/markets/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/markets/)

2%+ or 2%- depth actually show how much money is needed to move the price up to 2%

Even for BTC that is child's play for whales! As of reading, at the biggest exchange (Binance), ""only"" 17M (298\~BTCs) is needed to move the price up 2%, so it's quite easy to ""fabricate"" a bull sentiment

EDIT: it's also not difficult for whales also to ""fabricate"" a bear sentiment (32M as of now - 561\~ BTCs)

So be aware of sudden changes, sometimes it's just whales playing games (often with/against each other)

EDIT2: To everyone thinking that these are huge amounts of BTCs, the biggest ""private"" BTC wallet has over 100k BTCs... yeah... it takes less than 0,5% of their entire supply to move the market by a significant margin, it's fucking scary",1638330070.0,9

Moons are only one of soon to be hundreds of Reddit community points, were never intended to be worth real money, and Reddit has never done a KYC step before handing out millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency to anonymous people (which has gotta be making their lawyers nervous in the face of SEC crackdowns lately). They will definitely be under pressure to reign this experiment in, and take steps back toward them being intangible community rewards and not accidental speculative assets.

Moons aren't even the ***first*** of the community tokens, and if they ever do actually hit mainnet/exchange listings the whales are gonna unload like we've never seen yet because there was no cost to acquire them, so any price is better than zero.

It'll be a race to the bottom. We've already seen this start over the last few weeks actually with about a 15-20% price drop already.",1638331665.0,12

I'm certainly bullish short term on MOONs, but it might not hold its value long term for all the reasons you mentioned. 

I do see whales buying up MOONs though, so for some the cost isn't exactly zero. Also with mainnet/exchange listings it also means more potential buyers, but you're right in saying the sell pressure will likely be much higher than the amount that want to buy.",1638331954.0,2

Imagine you mine ETH.

By only mining $10 USD worth of ETH per day, you're making a POLICE OFFICER day salary.

(electricity is almost 10 times cheaper here than in the US)

&#x200B;

And we all know here, that making $10 USD a day with crypto, is not really that difficult, either you can mine it with not a lot of effort nor investment or you get some NFT game and that's it.No taxes, no real work or effort, no time wasted, and you basically doubled your salary.

Compare that to opening a business in a country like mine, where taxation goes up to 106% (yes, it's not a typo, one hundred and six) plus the hours you have to put in, plus crime, etc.

ps: some of these facts are based in my experience living in Argentina and being a police officer for years.

Eth hit a point where the network is running at max capacity ALL THE TIME around October 2021. Eth will only continue to be used more in the future, which means more people bidding up the price of eth gas fees.

Only 4.9% of Eth txs are on L2 solutions right now. Eth needs to drive users to L2 solutions FASTER than new users are using L1 solutions. That's not happening right now and that tipping point is probably pretty far away.

Eth gas is going to be a total shit show in 2022. There is no upper limit to eth gas fees, it's just users out competing each other by bidding for high gas fees. It doesn't take a lot of new txs beyond max capacity of the eth network to continue ballooning the gas fees. Make Eth 5% more popular and gas fees go up x2 or x3.

4031,CryptoCurrency,To those of you screaming about Ethereum's gas fees: L2's exist. Use them.,roberthonker,1638314890.0,189,139,0.74,"As beautifully explained on this Bankless livestream, splitting blockchains into different layers is the future: https://youtu.be/xjxyjgWiqLE

All L1s currently have a monolithic design - with their consensus layer, data layer, and transaction layer handled on the same blockchain. By decoupling these layers and offloading them to L2s, these layers can be scaled independently - producing lower gas fees, higher TPS, all while maintaining decentralization.

To further explain this point, I’ll use rollups and Ethereum as an example. 

A common way for other L1s to increase their TPS is by simply having fewer nodes. The fewer nodes a blockchain has, the quicker it can reach consensus because less validators need to agree on a transaction. For comparison, Solana has ~1000 nodes and Ethereum has ~300,000.

The tradeoff of having fewer nodes is that your blockchain is more centralized (which really goes against the whole the entire point of a blockchain!). 

By offloading your transaction layer to another party, you not only maintain decentralization, but you could scale your TPS by orders of magnitude. This is because rollups don’t 300,000 nodes to do their job. In theory they could be reduced to 1 or 2 nodes and far beat out Solana’s TPS bottlenecked by 1000 nodes.

For the gas fees, offloading transactions = less congestion on the blockchain = lower gas fees. The livestream did a good job of how each layer works together synergistically.

Bottom line, an L1 doesn’t need to do everything and I’m starting to believe that it shouldn’t. Different L1s popping up offering better TPS and lower gas fees always come with a caveat (in most cases more centralization). Ethereum is far ahead with this concept and their roadmap makes that clear.",1638330449.0,4

1) Cheat

2) Outsmart everybody else

3) Be first.

I am not smart enough to cheat so I try to be first.

seven ways of losing money in crypto

1) Get hacked/forgot your passwords

2) Cheated on by an centralised exchange that trades against your position (the Bitfinex/Binance business model)

3) Lose it all on fees

4) Be last.

5) Forget to cash out during  a bull market

6) Forget to cash in during a bear market

7) Goverment made it illegal and confiscated yours cause you did not have your keys. not your keys not your coins. (this one will reck 95% of you guys soon cause high fee chains bamboozle you in to NEVER withdrawing)

I always sell half my bags at 100% gains so I am never last.  I cash out at least 33% during a bull market to have fiat bags for the next bear market. I don't day trade. I make sure I am always a ratio short and long so if the market crashes down my short leg goes up. During a bear market I am 70% short and 30% long. During a bull market I am 60% long and 40%. Volatility has not gotten to me since 2017 and I generally speaking make more money during the bear market when everybody is willing to sell you the gold that they now believe is dogshit wrapped in catshit.

You're in high school, the teacher may be good or bad, but almost none of them have the resume that you're expecting(or you're in an incredibly good school district). What you _ought_ to expect is that they express the core principles in a digestible form for you. That's what makes a great teacher. It's perfectly fine to find value in expressing information rather than applying that information or discovering new information.

I had a marketing class, many moons ago, in high school which I took purely to get a credit. The only memory that I have of it was working through the return on investment for the discounted boxes of Krispy Kreme donuts the class bought to help fund a trip and then being able to successfully pitch the teacher on letting me independently co-opt that discounted rate. I spent a few weeks taking a ~1.5 hour round trip journey to the Krispy Kreme bakery so that I could sell boxes of donuts during lunch periods. Earned a tidy profit from that venture!

to elaborate, I think the ""resume"" goes a lot further, assuming the individual is passionate about it and able to convey that passion. We don't pay teachers squat–as a result the field doesn't get the respect it deserves in all circles and doesn't attract talent. Teaching (and administration) may attract people who are passionate and educated at *teaching*, and that is great. But it does nothing to attract the best and brightest in the fields that school is the only place very young people will learn, ie science, art, filmmaking, writing, technology, politics, finance, etc.

They should make those Nobel winners and top execs etc spend a certain amount of time teaching middle or high school, maybe for some kind of tax credit or student loan refund. Because those successful professionals are the people who spark kids' interest, and even in ""bad"" schools, get them to want to make movies instead of drop out.

In the business realm, defining profit is one thing. That's easy. You don't trust a CEO to define profit anyways. That's the CFO's job*.
 Thinking through seeking a profit is another matter entirely.

This is entirely off the cuff and written by an older person, but an example idea is to take a well-to-do but not elite high status profession to kids. Influencers, streamers, whatever. Someone who earns $100k-$500k/year. Worth through what they have to do to achieve this. For an influencer, how long does it take to do makeup for a photoshoot, how long do photos take, etc, etc. Work through what the # of hours realistically is and what the implied hourly rate is.

There are tons of ways to apply concepts from business to problems to think though all the little details which ultimately are the things which you need to get out of the class.

Hopefully your business teacher sparks at least a little bit of curiosity!

There's many first time users who dump massive wads of capital into shit coins and then lose everything due to a lack of research or a basic understanding of the technology. Arguably situations like this will continue to perpetuate the whole ""crypto is a scam"" thought process.

Nano has its own value proposition alongside a few other currency coins buts its the best at it - nothing is so effective at basic value transfer so it should take market share from the ones which are higher in market cap but worse performance. 

Instant transactions with finality in seconds. Complete free to use is quite brilliant. Those accepting it are incentivised to run nodes as the savings on fees outweigh a node cost. Fees and slippage on 1 foreign currency order would be enough to run a node for a month and my business does dozens every month, and pays thousands in merchant fees too. I see value in this every day. For those shilling a 0.0001 fee coin... Who wants to pay any fee no matter how small if I send 1 I don't want someone to receive 0.9999

So many potential use cases can be for any little micro transactions online, it can be used for FX trading and remittances, ieven for transferring value within the cryptoverse such as the 2miners pool model. There's a lot of potential but it does seem to be getting riskier that it won't happen this bull cycle.

4651,CryptoCurrency,Still hodling NANO. Try your best to either make me sell it or keep hodling.,mihnealazar,1638280098.0,1042,698,0.85,"All this depends on what happens in the crypto market. I am in this for the original goal of crypto. To have a decentralized digital cash & store of value. For this goal, I would posit that not only is Nano the best solution, but that it's hard to imagine a better solution.

It's hard to get faster than sub-second, and it's hard to be cheaper than feeless. It's hard to be more energy efficient than Nano, and any gains are going to be extremely small. 

In terms of scaling, being able to scale both through software improvements, through hardware and bandwidth getting ever better over time, and through people spinning up stronger nodes with a bigger network seems like a fantastic solution.

As a medium of exchange, characteristics seem fairly hard to beat.

In terms of a [store of value](https://senatus.substack.com/p/why-nano-is-the-ultimate-store-of-value-and-reserve-currency-3b0318844bc8), it's hard to beat zero inflation and zero fees, meaning zero leakage. It's hard to beat Nano's energy efficiency for corporation's ESG demands. Perhaps most importantly, it's hard to beat Nano's decentralization game. While every PoS and PoW coin [naturally centralizes over time](https://senatus.substack.com/p/on-crypto-as-a-store-of-value-bitcoins), Nano decentralizes over time.

Given that cryptocurrencies depend on decentralization for security, that's exactly the trend that we want to see.

*If*, and this is a big if, people start recognising these fundamentals and are genuinely interested in crypto for more than just a get-rich-quick scheme, Nano shines. 

That might not happen for a while, but the signs are there. There is literally no more efficient base layer to transfer money on, and it's hard to conceive of a harder store of value. 

I have no idea when and if more people recognise that, but I gladly place my bet that at some point more people will. 

I see that as a far safer bet than investing elsewhere and hoping people overlook the glaring flaws present in most of crypto, and hoping to sell out before they do.",1638283687.0,350

- fear of inflation —> there will never be more nanos in circulation.
- nano is efficient on energy usage —-> at some point, it will become an important aspect of the world financial system. How to be efficient in a world that desesperately needs it. 
- it’s ultra fast (it contrast with BTC or any other crypto for that matter). 
- there is no fees —-> people are starting to understand that fees can become quite problematic. Look at ETH.
- there is no shady things going on with the NF team, no manipulation because you have invested hundred of thousands of dollars in mining rigs. 

Plus, the NF foundation recently started to market a bit more and they started to push NANO. Think about how important every boxes are in the big picture of what should crypto be. 

Personally, I love the idea of crypto. But I just cannot buy something that support an intensive energy usage; that represent a model of the world that is completely disconnected from reality and I don’t want to encourage that.

And there’s quite a lot of people offering things to buy and sell on the sub. Sure you’ll see dumbasses arguing shit to avoid hypocrisy but people do give it real-world value just like Nano. Someone set up a neat site to be able to buy gold anonymously without showing up on any card statements. It’s purely legal, but the purchase stays anonymous. Someone else offered their house in Italy for Monero with all the details. Papers and everything, just paid for by Monero. 

Maybe it’s for you, maybe you’re spoiled by the high speeds of transactions so something else would be better. Neat thing with Monero is the more people use it, the fees get drastically lower.",1638282142.0,6

\- Nano is the best Store of Value -  your purchase-power doesn't go away via debasement or fees. it has ZERO Inflation, no more coins will be create, all coins are already in circulation, 1 Nano = 1 Nano, always, and ZERO Fees.

\- Nano is the Fastest - no other decentralized network can match its speed. Transactions are fully confirmed and irreversible in under 1 second. Its scalability is not limited by code (no fixed block-times), and is as fast as the bandwidth and hardware can handle.

\- Nano is Green - consensus does not rely on energy-intensive Proof of Work, making Nano over 1 million times more energy efficient.

\- Nano is Fair - Influence over consensus is proportional to one's holdings / investment. There is no minimum required holding to open a wallet, the ledger is fully auditable, no waiting-lines.

We - in hindsight correctly - predicted that the market would dump almost anything (except meme coins) that didn't have solutions for DeFi and NFT's - the time for promises of future updates was over, and there is plenty of functional DeFi around.

It was one of the best financial choices we ever made. She has earned quite a lot, liquidated enough for comfortable living, while still having plenty invested in the DeFi space, about 5x the initial nano fueled deposit. I.e. for the last 6 months, she has funded her European upper middle class living standards from the transition from Nano into DeFi, while at the same time having a 5x gain on the original investment still remaining. It's invested in various liquidity pools and validator staked.

She is still heavily into DeFi and has not re-bought the stake in Nano and probably won't until Nano one day shows real promise in the DeFi/NFT space, not just rumors of something.

I mostly just hold crypto (and never sell) because she is a crypto professional, with an uni degree in the field. I take an active interest in her world, and get to advise on market movements and nerd about macroeconomic and socioeconomic issues with her - I strongly believe that QE is stealth inflation on wage earners, and has fueled this whole market (for crypto and stocks) for the past decade.

My personal prediction for Nano itself is that the coin *might* be dying, but the tech behind it would be a fantastic stablecoin for Amazon and AWS (like the rumors on /r/nanocurrency). For Amazon and AWS they cannot use a coin with a fluctuating price like Nano, they can however very much use a stablecoin build with the same tech - feeless and instant. How that benefits the wider nano community I don't know, but its something I'm watching and will update her whenever it shows some promise.

The market started moving again last year largely because of DeFi and, more broadly, smart contracts.

You can argue the pros and cons of Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, Solana, etc, but the future they are moving towards - a vast, interoperable, universe of financial applications - is the universe we are building.

Nano does fast payments but doesn't provide dApps 
Nano does cheap payments, but loses value

It doesn't increase in value the way BTC does, it doesn't allow DeFi the way the L1s do and it doesn't provide stability like the stablecoins do.

Once we have near-feeless and near-instant stablecoins in DeFi what do we need Nano for? You can't send it across networks either, unlike all the smart contract bridges.

I agree with everything that you've said but I do have a few concerns.

Firstly, the name change was an awful decision in my opinion. Nano is too much of a generic name and it's extremely difficult to Google it. The whole marketing aspect has been non existent and what they have done has pushed it backwards rather than forwards (i.e. the name change).

The bitgrail case really needs to be solved. There's a bag of Nanos that have been but up by the bitgrail trustees. I really wonder what will happen to this. This has the potential to dump the value of Nano further. Or alternatively, perhaps an exchange like coinbase will pick this up to start trading it which will drive the price up instead.

Currently I'm still holding my Nano. I think there's a lot of crypto out there trying to do lots of different and complicated things. How many of them work? What crypto is actually used as a transfer of funds right now? It's a long shot but I'm still banking on Nano actually being used as currency.",1638291284.0,33

Lightning makes that redundant.

XNO-BTC down 96%. It's complete garbage as a store of value.

Money should never have to compete for resources with other use cases, otherwise there will be no more resources left for money.

Value transfer is the least profitable use of resources you can have. If you have any other functionality, what you have in fact is other use cases competing for resources, and value transfer will always lose that competition.

No platform that offers anything beyond value transfer (smart contracts) will ever be a functional long term solution for value transfer. People will find ways to use the network in more profitable ways and value transfer will lose the race for resources. There's no way around that.

No matter how low your fees are now, if the people can use your network for other things, the limited resources will always be used for those other things and you won't be able to make simple transactions.

ETH, xlm, polka-dot, Solana, avax, iota whatever. None of those will ever be a long term solution for value transfer, no matter how low their fees are now.

Unless their throughput exceeds all value transfer needs of the world + all other possible use cases, which of course is never gonna happen because we can always find new use cases, the first thing that is gonna be left behind in terms of usage is simple value transfers.

Money should never have to compete for resources with other use cases, otherwise there will be no more resources left for money.

Value transfer is the least profitable use of resources you can have. If you have any other functionality, what you have in fact is other use cases competing for resources, and value transfer will always lose that competition.

No platform that offers anything beyond value transfer (smart contracts) will ever be a functional long term solution for value transfer. People will find ways to use the network in more profitable ways and value transfer will lose the race for resources. There's no way around that.

No matter how low your fees are now, if the people can use your network for other things, the limited resources will always be used for those other things and you won't be able to make simple transactions.

ETH, xlm, polka-dot, Solana, avax, iota whatever. None of those will ever be a long term solution for value transfer, no matter how low their fees are now.

Unless their throughput exceeds all value transfer needs of the world + all other possible use cases, which of course is never gonna happen because we can always find new use cases, the first thing that is gonna be left behind in terms of usage is simple value transfers.

Nano not having smart contract functionalities is a strength, not a weakness.",1638306076.0,3

Good thing there can't be any extra Nano printed ever then, right?

> Lightning makes that redundant.

Sorry, I should have added ""secure"" and ""non-custodial"". Opening, closing and changing channels, locking up funds for it, all on a base layer that does just a few TPS, combined with routing problems if the LN gets to any serious size, adding to the security issues with Lightning, mean that no, Lightning does not make anything redundant.

It's been battle tested many times? Can I ask - do you think of Bitcoin as constantly crippled? Because if not, I wonder whether it's fair to call Nano crippled when it was still performing at a higher level than Bitcoin, feelessly.

> What is priced in Nano? Nothing.

Out of curiosity, are many things priced in Bitcoin? I don't think much is priced in Nano, no. Msot of crypto is still fairly volatile, so I'd expect people to price in fiat and take payment in crypto if anything.

> XNO-BTC down 96%. It's complete garbage as a store of value.

So I just checked - BTC is down 90% against Nano when we're cherry picking dates. BTC is also down against Nano over a full cycle, and since start of this year.

I don't think we should focus on past price performance though - there have been plenty of times when Bitcoin has been performing badly, and there are many coins it has been performing badly against.",1638288719.0,30

All cryptocurrencies are printed out of thin air. They're software. What matters is *fair distribution*, and Nano was given away for free via a CAPTCHA faucet (aka human PoW). Audit here:

> Lightning makes that redundant.

Have you used LN? It comes with a lot of drawbacks due to its reliance on Bitcoin's 1st layer - opening/closing channels, online requirements, watchtowers, liquidity issues, routing issues, etc

> Never been battle tested. And has been crippled with spamming despite a few users.

Nano has been around since 2015 and is still going strong. Even Bitcoin faced spam issues in its early days:

> And since it was conjured out of thin air and distributed opaquely it can never be decentralised.

The same can be said about any cryptocurrency, since we don't know who owns the addresses or hashrate. How are you measuring decentralization? By any objective measure, Nano is already quite decentralized:

The possibilities are only just starting to become clear. This is the benefit over fiat. Nano does nothing I cant do with my own bank account.

NANO was able to climb back to the $17 range this year briefly. There are folks who bought it for more than that in the mere couple of weeks it traded for higher during the beginning of 2018. If they still hold, they’ve been deep in the red for nearly 4 years.

Money should never have to compete for resources with other use cases, otherwise there will be no more resources left for money.

Value transfer is the least profitable use of resources you can have. If you have any other functionality, what you have in fact is other use cases competing for resources, and value transfer will always lose that competition.

No platform that offers anything beyond value transfer (smart contracts) will ever be a functional long term solution for value transfer. People will find ways to use the network in more profitable ways and value transfer will lose the race for resources. There's no way around that.

No matter how low your fees are now, if the people can use your network for other things, the limited resources will always be used for those other things and you won't be able to make simple transactions.

ETH, xlm, polka-dot, Solana, avax, iota whatever. None of those will ever be a long term solution for value transfer, no matter how low their fees are now.

Unless their throughput exceeds all value transfer needs of the world + all other possible use cases, which of course is never gonna happen because we can always find new use cases, the first thing that is gonna be left behind in terms of usage is simple value transfers.

Should this affect what coins I stake/get?,LoriannCline,1638328766.0,18,42,0.91,"ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment, and it pretty much is just a proposal for changes to be made to Ethereum protocol. The 20th proposal was a pretty good one and it’s been in use since then. Technically speaking, ETH is not ERC20 complaint, but can be used as gas to pay for ERC20 complaint tokens. Again, ERC20 is simply the name for the standards for which some tokens that run on the Ethereum network comply with. One of these standards is that each token is fungible (identical and valued the same as all other tokens in that contract) which differs from ERC721 which is the proposal for non fungible tokens (NFTs, which may be identical but are not necessarily valued the same) 
TRC20 is just the Tron version of ERC20, not specifically the 20th proposal, but it is the collection of standards for tokens that exist on the Tron blockchain. 
BEP20 stands for Binance smart chain Evolution Proposal and again the 20 is irrelevant as it’s not specifically the actual 20th proposal. 

If you’re lost as to why they’re called proposals, these protocols are developed by a bunch of people and there isn’t traditional leadership in all instances. So people develop stuff on their own and then propose these changes be merged into final builds and everyone else votes yes or no. 

Now, that we know some of this. Why would someone chose one blockchain over another? Well, ETH has the biggest audience and the highest fees. Binance smart chain is super fast and the fees are low but it’s not quite as popular as Ethereum. Tron is super fast, very low fees, but not as popular as Ethereum. So there’s trade offs to every blockchain, and the devs do what they think is best. Sometimes (lots of the time) something will start on ETH and then migrate to another chain. Sometimes a snapshot is taken of the original holders and your existing ETH wallet will allow you to claim on the new chain, sometimes both chains exist side by side, and sometimes you’re forced to burn your existing erc20 tokens to get main net coins from the chain that was migrated to.

5493,CryptoMarkets,"Weekly Discussion Megathread - November 28, 2021 (GMT+0)",AutoModerator,1638108013.0,136,8,1.0,"OK so I recently made a nice profit trading based on the chart of CUBE (Somnium Space Cubes. a metaverse vr thing) I actually sold too early and left like 4k in profit on the table.  So then I bought into TEZOS XTZ and that languished pretty badly and I managed to get out of that with a slight profit.  I then bought back into CUBE at about 19.70.

My question is does anyone else like this trade? or should I get out.  I feel like the metaverse is so hot right now with both SAND and MANA crushing.  But the huge moves in MANA and SAND have me worried that I could end up a huge bagholder if they start to tank badly so that's why I'm worried about trying to piggyback on those coins. The problem with CUBE is that it only trades on one major exchange atm so the volume is kind of bad.  I feel like based on the chart that it's really set to move a lot higher but Bitcoin volatility seems to be giving bots a lot of room to hold it down with the low volume and lack of retail buying because confidence is sort of low.",1638112156.0,3

5836,CryptoMarkets,This is me more times than I would like to admit.,fluentinimagery,1638261080.0,53,368,0.97,"depends on which blockchain you are on. The ""gold standard"" is probably Anchor that gives you around 20% APY on stables.

On Avalanche you can probably find some decent stuff as well, although I've personally quit Avalanche. Check out Snowball, yieldwolf or Beefy on Avalanche

I'm currently mostly degening on Fantom, because they have some great dexes with cool farms and pools. You probably want to check out Grim or Reaper. Those are auto-compounders.

So the reason why some of these stable-farms give such high APY is because they give you rewards on their own DEX token. So, you farm and they reward you with some bullshit-token that nobody wants. So everybody just keeps selling those all the time and the price of your rewards falls down. But auto-compounders just sell those rewards automatically for you, then take the reward and use it to buy some more of the stuff you're currently farming and add that to your stake. So you're getting rewards on top of your rewards. Pretty nifty.

Just be careful, some farms have a deposit fee and the APY can change over time

You should also look into MIM (Magic Internet Money), which oftentimes has great APYs. MIM is currently expanding to more and more chains. Once it lands on a new chain, you'd want to take advantage of all of their high APYs

To send money and keep it sercure quickly the  reasons it was more mainstream older demographic un accepting of tech and some banks don’t want any external communications with other banks. That’s it I mean 8 years ago chase and capital one had this ability to send instant free of charge money to others phones locations for cash and even long distance in seconds they just charged large fees international sending. it’s kinda all a joke right. Like “let’s make these things called cryptos and let’s get Americans to spend all they money on them and than we will have all there money” “how you gunna do that” “ simple tell them there money isn’t safe” 

Smart contracts are so flawed. The thing they are protecting you from is the same thing that can use them to charge transactions from you without you knowing. Ever been hit with minor fees twice in single transaction and wondered why. Go check out some of the smart contracts that allow people to cover up warnings, take your money as transaction fee and tell you it a minor fee or sometimes it says network fee. That is why they are so high everyone writing the contracts have a hands in the cookie jar. I never thought I would say this but the only cryptos I have come across that are actually doing what it says it is doing is bitcoin, nano, polygon, Algorand, kucoin and vechain. I have found serious issues in all the major coins except bitcoin. I am not sure if some of DEFi like uniswap and sushi swap even know what is happening to there customers because if they do they in on it. Fake and malicious coins all over the place. 

It’s funny because everyone concern is being hacked like this dude or chick is sitting there head banging typing away on command prompt hardcore solving equations and breaking in. No people that’s movies they say “hi how is going, I saw that you are interested in a nft come join our community” you go there it has to legit organized well ran group. People that is the hack.

A screener gives you the best set of stocks to implement your strategy.  There is a reason behind each parameter.  Some people look for higher volatility.

You backtest strategies, not screeners.  You select parameters for screeners based on what they do for you, then pick the top few stocks to trade.  For example, you could do sentiment analysis on the top 10 to narrow it down to 4.

Quantitative: At the very least, another person can test your strategy(if given away) and achieve the same result  you did over the same time period you tested. Like a scientist for example. 
Example: if I gave you my current algorithm running live we will virtually achieve the same profit/drawdown etc. all else being equal(Broker/Lots/Re-optimization/VPS) and obviously not given to all of Reddit.
Technical: involves interpretation which is subjective to the person using said strategy. Regardless of how “discipline” you believe you are, this will still lead to inaccurate testing as confirmation bias will be unavoidable. 
Example: Support/Resistance lines, Bullish pennant, bearish flag, price action(“seeing” the price go up) solely based on Wicks/closes with zero calculations. The same exact statistics can not be achieved if retested multiple times from either yourself or others.

Couple that with volume increases that show follow through from institutional amounts of money and you got yourself a good start. Pick 1-2 patterns and stick with it, get good at trading these pattern specifically.

Do all that and TA works. Not 100% of the time of course, but it will give you and edge. Learn money management and make rules that become your overriding priority and you'll be profitable as well.
Imo it works a lot better than fundamentals or randomly buying and holding individual stocks.

In other words, while the self-fulfilling prophetic notion of enough people believing something makes said thing come true, I do not believe it applies in chart-readings because there is not an overwhelming majority that not only agree on the future of the chart, but also act upon these supposed readings to satisfy the pattern.

For example, if you take 100 chart-enthusiasts, you can be assured that not everyone will agree on the same present pattern. Humans are pattern-seekers by nature and heavily vulnerable to biases and these factors play a heavy role on what someone sees in a chart. Someone may find a way to stretch a pattern into a bullish head and shoulders, while another sees a very apparent cup and handle and now there are two contradictory patterns and predictions as to what the price is going to do. So now, not only are there different conclusions, but now they are fighting one another to realize what they believe to be the chart's future as a result of its overall sentiment. Head and shoulders guy is now shorting the stock because it's clearly bearish, and cup and handle guy is long because it was clearly bullish. How can the chart realize either side of these predictions with such a heavy back and forth? This isn't even taking into account the fact that TA traders are a subset of retail traders which account for < 15% of the market as well as all the other factors driving price movement such as news, earnings, the stock's beta, as well as funds buying/selling large percentages of equity (all random, unpredictable events by the way).

My point is that you are proposing to me that retail, chart-reading traders use chart patterns as a psychology and a tool to gauge the overall optimistic or pessimistic nature of a chart in its short to immediate term, however, I frankly do not believe there is a significant enough portion of volume being directed solely from this subset of a subset of traders in order to realize a chart's supposed potential. 

I agree with you that traders may use TA charts to drive home their own intrinsic biases and as you say psychological conditions, but that only further proves that it holds no scientific significance.

Hypothetically, if I was offered one additional talent (in universe where actual magic or extremely advanced genetic engineering exists) I wouldn't choose many of the talents I have yearned for over the years like having perfect pitch and the ability to pick up any instrument and just play by ear, or being able to draw near photo-realistic sketches of anything my imagination could conjure. Probably others at different times too.

But having always been fascinated by cosmology, quantum physics, the fact that our universe and (non-quantum) reality (or illusion of it) can be explained by mathematical models created by fellow human beings, and number sequences that appear everywhere in nature, like Fibonacci sequences and possessing an innate and preternatural ability to be able to understand and speak those languages would be the greatest gift I could ever receive. I've read many a book that covers these subjects, but couched in language gives us non-mathematicians a glimpse into their magic, but never fully grasped. 

These is really dumb, pseudo-profound question that is impossible to answer, but I'll ask anyway, do you believe that the varied languages of mathematics came into existence with the birth of the universe and were simply discovered and not invented by man? Doesn't that speak to the idea a 'designed universe' and perhaps just a simulation? I prefer the simulation idea myself, as a natural existing universe born out of chaos that places us as somehow as possessing monumental significance given 'our' ability to interpret the macro-universe in a language that just happens to describe the most mundane to the most extraordinary with uncanny accuracy. I have no basis, nor do I possess the intellect to ever further that discussion, which kinda renders a lot of life pretty meaningless to me at times, I feel like I just using up natural resources for what? The ephemeral pleasures and experiences that a consumer society offers me. Damned if I know. But I also know that I'm damned privileged to have the luxury of asking such questions, when a over a third of me fellow humans don't know if they'll make it through the week, or even day. And that's at the extreme, dire end of poverty. I'm 99.99% sure that the average reply to one of your custom charts which I guessed triggered these familiar regrets, envy and existential woes (which I should have grown out of many years ago.)

If you can find some security agnostic signal by doing that then your best bet might be to trade it across many assets, weighted by your signal strength for each one. A simple (shit) example of such an edge and how you might deploy it to many assets:

Maybe for any given price time series you’ve found a way to pick out some n such that in current market conditions if the price goes up n days in a row with daily closes C(0),...,C(n) and returns of R(i)=C(i)/C(i-1), it’s more likely that the price goes up to C(n)R(n) before it drops back down to C(n-1) again. Some weird momentum phenomenon maybe. So you set a take profit at C(n)R(n), stop loss at C(n-1) and you weight your position sizes by the R(n) for each asset you want to trade. When a signal for a new asset appears, if all your capital is already in play you can reduce sizes in your other positions and allocate to the new one accordingly (idk, fees will hurt this so some other heuristic or keeping cash in hand might be a better idea).

But this will probably be shit even if you can find a way to get this ever changing magical n for each asset without overfitting and if fees are cheap. Mainly because there could well be some underlying factors driving the strong performance of your highest weighted assets, so this attempt at “diversification” will probably just end up giving you massive exposure to a couple of factors at any given time.

The way to get around that is to find a way to construct a portfolio whilst taking into consideration the strength of your signals for each asset *and* the correlations between their returns. And herein lies my biggest gripe with predicting from individual price series: it ignores *so much* information on the table about the relationships between different assets. The Instagram traderbro TA chartist simply cannot process this quantity of information, and I can recall seeing around here that while some people do believe they have security agnostic signals and are deploying them across multiple assets, there’s very little discussion about how to combine them efficiently.

TLDR - technical analysis in the broadest sense is certainly not useless, but you’ll likely get the most out of it by placing some emphasis on the relationships between assets, not just by throwing either voodoo magic Head and Shoulders anti dandruff lines at candlesticks or even your fanciest Long Short Trading Machine neural nets at individual price series.",1638099525.0,7

I do not dispute your claim ,it is valid, they also consistently win. In stocks, there are plenty of ways (approaches)  to consistently win.

Person B: very good quants takes $100000, makes many trades in a year, all transparently displays transactions to you and me openly.

The chances of Person B ROI are higher than Person A, by its reliability and consistency.

On your thought process: If I got you right, I am asking myself the same questions. Did it catch a real signal there and is it sustainable? Only way I see to find out is put it to the test live. Works. More or less. Could be better and probably will decay over the next month or so. 

So I am taking all the learnings I got from all the great Input here, read up, apply it all and go again. Fun!

I have other ideas on taking more realtime input than EMAs, like looking at order books (already did, nothing working yet), most recent trades, social Media sentiment (too much work currently) etc. 

Still have to do some catching up with the new info I got here, but... as long as the model with lookahead on the targets can make up for the lag of the indicators, I am taking it until I got something better.

""The best solution to avoid the look-ahead bias is a thorough assessment of the validity of developed models and strategies.""

My results are not exceptional, so I am not using information that would not otherwise be available at that point in time, other than using the lookahead on the MACD to give the model a hint where a change in direction might happen, which it can apparently grasp quite well, at least accuracy wise.

The model does NOT get the lookahead as Input, obviously.

You can use a linear regression model to get the best values for a particular indicator. Linear regression is less likely to overfit than more advanced models and does not require much historical data. Dont use any indicator that is not normalised across different stocks (e.g raw data) and if using linear models you need a somewhat linear relationship. Non linear models like random forests can work but more often than not will just overfit unless using lots of data to train (not ideal when market conditions are constantly changing). Any deep learning method used direcly for trading is a fools game (gradient decent does not work when the gradient is constantly changing).

2 caveats is:

1. your trading is taxed a bit lower than your job and you can write some off

2. your trading is volatile and uncertain. As a rule of thumb, I feel like I have to double my income before claiming it's income replacement

3. depends on the amount of time you can spend on your algo. If you're happy with 20 hrs a week, you can make your algo work AND earn your 500k job (or downgrade to like 400k but be less stressful) and have your cake and eat it

Can a strategy be validated though.... It depends what the strategy is. Strategy that's predicts the future completely and accurately, probably can not.

But if you have a momentum chaser that detects momentum early(enough) and gets out soon after momentum fades, or a mean-reverter that's smart enough to turn itself off when momentum develops, or even a bid-ask collector that manages inventory, widens the spread when possible while being aggressive enough to catch enough of the spread, you're golden.

Of course with fancy buckets you can have some weird edge cases like: a trade (tick) arrives that's triple your normal volume bucket size. Do you return one volume OHLC bar or 3 bars that look the same, or some ""empty"" bars? Similar thing goes for your $ value bars. I guess this would depend on how the bars are gonna be used, your call.

 >James Harris Simons (; born 25 April 1938) is an American mathematician, billionaire hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is the founder of Renaissance Technologies, a quantitative hedge fund based in East Setauket, New York. He and his fund are known to be quantitative investors, using mathematical models and algorithms to make investment gains from market inefficiencies. Due to the long-term aggregate investment returns of Renaissance and its Medallion Fund, Simons is described as the ""greatest investor on Wall Street,"" and more specifically ""the most successful hedge fund manager of all time"".

""Traditional momentum"" is less about the variable definition in TA (which indeed is useless), but more as a description of the crowd behavior where ""an extended period of time where there are less sellers than buyers(or vv) and the trading activity keeps pushing the price with sustained demand (trading volume can be used to distinguish between strong and fickle momentum). It's a qualitative description of the state of the trading crowd, an imbalance in progress that's persistent and often self-sustaining (as in, price action brings in more actors that support the trend). See, it's not an indicator, it's a regime, or state of a complex multi-agent system. The side-effect of which is price increase that's gradual, prolonged and supposedly exploitable. MACD is just a crude tool that attempts a rule-of thumb description of this state. Yes, MACD can be used once you know exactly what signs of trading activity in the market you're after. But ""how to use MACD to trade profitably"" articles will surely disappoint. And adding MACD with some random parameters (or even opt params) is likely to bomb. It's ""spot the trend early"" game with momentum and most moving average-based indicators just won't cut it.

You can aggregate on the fly and calculate your variables and emit signals on tick arrival/recalculation already, so bars may not be the best representation.

Why time-bars are so popular is because this is the cheapest type of market datafeed, if your data-vendor can supply you with other type of bars, by all means feel free to use them, no harm in that. But if constructing all these ""fancy"" bars is on you.... To me it sounded more like an unnecessary overhead, if I can calculate tick-updated aggregates myself. Depends on what you're looking for, if you strategy demands something very similar to construction, say, of volume bars, well, you can invest in volume bar data pipeline. If you can afford tick data this is a tiny additional expense.

To answer your question, yes, tried constructing those ""other"" bars. But because their re-calculation is triggered by same event (tick arrival) as would trigger host of other calculations, building a separate pipeline to just build bars seems hardly worth it.",1637808598.0,2

Try to code a simple strategy using Python and QuantConnect platform it's very good for backtesting.

What I understood is overfitting would be tweaking a strategy to adapt to your dataset. 
What you are saying is that I should take a bot online if it performs well on most of the datasets? 
That being said am I right thinking that some strategies work better on some particular timeframes and setups? 
For instance if you take a simple MA cross bot it would do shit on smaller timeframes but do better on larger ones no ? So not every strategy is good for any timeframe",1637664169.0,4

Think about it this way, if you threw a million algos with different parameters at a dataset, how likely would it be that the best one was the best because of chance versus it accurately mapping a noisy & weak signal where numerous other actors are already working to capture and smooth out the edges?  Almost all valid signals are very weak, so you would probably never find a good strategy that way.  As a sidenote, this is the reason why it can be extremely difficult to use machine learning for price prediction (due to the ease of overfitting).  I would recommend focusing on 1 or 2 factor models which work across a number of timeframes and asset classes.",1637676901.0,1
