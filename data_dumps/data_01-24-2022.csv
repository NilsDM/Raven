And if you actually just think about it it makes a lot of sense. If you don’t have actors with their own nodes, and they delegate their holdings to someone with a node, and then those nodes can be made on AWS, GCP, Azure (in fact the vast majority are on these three platforms), then not only is the network not decentralized, we purposefully made 3 of the richest companies in the world a hell of a lot richer while sacrificing insane amounts of decentralization. 

Perhaps the most relevant example in the market today is SOL going down every 2 seconds. Having millisecond settlement time while the speed of light still exists, should worry everyone. There’s no distributed networking in the world that is capable of this, until the infrastructure for EVERYBODY (including weakest links) is at something like 40Gb/s.

Just the address, not the private key of it. No one really has the keys to that contract, it's programmatically created, hence it is immutable. 

So, to answer your question, you can't add the private key to a wallet. But it is a wallet, as in ""it holds money and can transact"" according to how it's programmed to transact.

I'll copy and paste a reply I wrote over in /r/Hedera regarding Hedera's overall business model (and roadmap, I guess), just cos ain't nobody got time rewriting. Last couple paragraphs are the relevant bit but the rest is context.

""Many enterprises prefer a private dag network at the core of their infrastructure and for areas where they simply do not need public consensus.

These are designed to be modular and interoperable - this is more akin to tradition databases but built on the same kind of technology. 

IBM offer a whole suite of modular services for enterprise use in this area, with Walmart and Land Rover being some of the notable users. 

Hashgraph is designed to interoperate with these networks seamlessly providing public consensus or other specific functions if needed. 

The information is immutably encoded with no single point of failure, this remains very valuable - the private networks are more databases where Hashgraph helps create the internet out of them and allows parties that wish to do so interact directly with each other's databases with absolute trust.

In order to achieve this, Hedera offer the HCS - the simple and seamless capability of using the consensus service and nothing else. This isn't limited to private networks, anyone can use it if they so desire, as long as they pay their fees. 

This is useful for many Hyperledger clients, and you'll notice a significant overlap when comparing them with Hedera ecosystem partners (Walmart are heavily involved in promoting a new universal standard for digital coupons built entirely on Hedera's Hashgraph for example)

They also offer the HTS - programmable tokens at the native layer with all the performance on offer from the Hashgraph Algorithm (these offer about 80% of the functionality of Smart Contracts according to Mance - the rest can obviously be covered by the EVM and competing projects - if needed they can absolutely develop a superior smart contract platform but Hyperledger is already taking a good part towards this so mutual value is found.

The idea of modular, interoperable, open source infrastructure building up web 3.0 is the whole idea. You don't achieve that when one project wins alone, Hedera nonetheless offers value to the other parties within the ecosystem - that's what we're all about right? Cut out inefficiency and utilise the value gained. Just maths.

This brings me to the Hedera Smart Contract Service 

Hedera themselves aim to fully integrate Hyperledger Besu, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in the coming weeks - allowing Ethereum based dApps to run within Hedera and interact seamlessly with the Hedera ecosystem.  

Once complete, all the Ethereum developers have to do is copy and paste their code into the virtual machine and suddenly their dApp is running perfectly yet with the ~300 TPS of Besu. Kind of a no brainer as we wait for Ethereum 2.0 - and once that is in place the EVM will be able to at least keep up with the open source product, and likely continue to outpace it in the long term.",1642685654.0,2

Ethereum has been the focus on development because it's been the most stable platform - yet It will literally be far better to run Eth dApps on Hedera and incredibly easy with no real risk.

I understand you can make up for the compromise elsewhere but surely you understand why this becomes less and less tenable compared to a layer one solution which apparently achieves optimal performance from a mathematical standpoint in terms of security, throughput, and efficiency, without an apparent compromise.

Maybe quantum computing shakes things up, maybe something else does. Layer 2s are less speculative than that but speculative nonetheless

""Enterprise use demands stability in price - you need to write up a budget including operating costs so that you can see whether engaging in that activity is viable for your business. You simply cannot do that with variable gas fees, certainly not those of Ethereum-  and even Polygon's offering has been demonstrated to be a long way off with even a relatively small transaction volume. 

Why would an enterprise adopt and use a product that can suddenly increase 100x in cost without warning? Let alone one that can double.

Furthermore, HBAR fees may be fixed but the council can adjust them as they see fit. 

For example, minting an NFT costs $1. Avery Dennison plan to tokenize trillions of products, DLA Piper started out looking at tokenizing real-estate, now their plans go much further than even that. Obviously the adjustability of fees go both ways, I'm not hinging my argument on this particular revenue stream, the point is there's a lot you've missed, including other transaction types with their own associated fees.

Right now, for cryptocurrency transactions the price is fixed at (I think) 0.0001 USD. This is useful in its own right because it allows micropayment based usecases - a market which is completely inconceivable to you right now.

This is adequate at the moment as it incentives adoption and creates new possibilities. 

Right now the plan is to fund node operators through the treasury in the short term, if the current fees prove to be untenable past that stage, they will be changed. Adequately incentivising node operators to secure the network is an integral part of the design.

If, in the future, it is deemed that this particular type of transaction should cost more (or less) then this can be done. 

If the USD falls out of favour, they can find something else to peg it to.

If the miners turn out to be right and DLT is really just about paying a lot of money to miners and hodlers, then they can ramp the fees right up if they so desire.

My point is that this control Hedera have is a unique strength - you might disagree with how they've utilised it (I trust them and their partners a hell of a lot more than a random redditor), but nonetheless, the competing options are simply inferior and nothing else. 

They cannot be controlled or fixed because the gas demands are driven by fundamental limitations in the architecture of the other networks. Hedera's architecture is better. That's why they are being adopted""

How does one take ETH or ERC tokens over to Hedera? I've never used it but given it is an alternative L1 I'm guessing some kind of trusted bridge.

I understand you can make up for the compromise elsewhere but surely you understand why this becomes less and less tenable compared to a layer one solution which apparently achieves optimal performance from a mathematical standpoint in terms of security, throughput, and efficiency, without an apparent compromise.

Compromise is decentralization. 'One day the companies on our network will run more of the nodes' isn't even a promise to become decentralised, it's distributing cost/responsibility of operation but not to a meaningful degree as it's hand selected node operators.

That's OK because it doesn't look like HBAR is really trying to compete with L2s. It's competing with enterprise blockchain. The TPS, etc etc etc, should all be way better- there are only 20 nodes. Ethereum ~10k is a fair baseline. Again HBAR isn't trying to compete on decentralization, that's fine, but it does mean as platform there is a compromise. Its not speed, UX or 'security' from external forces you sacrifice, it's the ability to (hypothetically) spin up a node and 'fact check' what the team says/does etc. 

Also the EVM compatible 'just ctrl+c ctrl+v' meme seems to imply 'it just works' but how can it reconcile different EVM implementations? Sure I buy ethereumJS to HBAR is copy+paste but what if the code isn't JS to begin with? I'm not technical enough to know so I'm asking authentically.

Well that's the thing, with Hedera's governance currently decentralized between a council of 25 legally accountable, term limited, real world institutions - each running a secure and high quality node with independent infrastructure - Hedera offers new qualities of transparency and regulation, and does not hinge on the dubious security of anonymous governance or overreaching developer control. 

In this current state I would go as far to say that it's more decentralized than any networks disproportionately using only a few centralized servers in a few geographically centralized location. The amount of nodes is also less relevant than the amount of nodes operators. 

What you missed is that this design is a deliberate approach to create the conditions needed for a permissionless, fully distributed network down the line - and yes, create a product secure enough for enterprise use (which fully aligns with the demands of secure public use in this case) 

Going permissionless straight off the bat without creating safeguards against exploitation means that while your network can be decentralized in theory, it is far less likely to be in reality. The truth is that the extremely wealthy disproportionately control these systems right now and there is no way to reliably reverse that. 

And there will be millions of nodes, run by us, on our phones. Hedera possessing genuine scalability means they are able to achieve incredible performance and security. When I say there's no compromise I really mean there just isn't one. It's pure mathematical efficiency at every level. 

They are competing with the Layer 2 of other networks by achieving what they do at the native layer - Hedera's own Layer 2s will be built as appropriate and will represent absolute technological advance - not petty competition. For example, ZK snarks are one of the more well designed Hedera Improvement Proposal made thus far and I would expect it to be on the way - reconciling private trust with public transparency.

Effective and transparent governance - not something Eth possesses I'm sorry to say - is an essential part of the equation - even a fourth prong to the 'Trilemma' if you ask me.

When your system is dependant on goodwill it is absolutely and irreconciably vulnerable to exploitation, take communism - another ideology which people love in theory but fell tragically short in practice because too much trust was given in those who controlled the means based on their 'commitment' to the 'greater good'.

Hedera offer universal zero trust architecture for the world - much larger in scope, requirements, and stakes than anything we've seen.

I'm honestly lacking in terms of the technical knowledge so I'm afraid I can't help to much with your developer based questions - don't really know what the process looks like 

I will say Hedera and the HBAR foundation offer a lot of technical support - both published and on-demand. The blog at Hedera.com might be a good place to start.

So my understanding is that the EVM used in Smart Contracts 1.0 currently supports most Ethereum based code running with the efficiency, low latency, and predictable fees of Hedera (note the predictable fees are rooted in the fact that you couldn't congest it if you tried, and would make me a lot of money trying). 

The tokens remain outside of the Hedera network however and smart contracts only run with a TPS equal to that of Ethereum- itself 

The Hyperledger Besu integration behind Smart Contracts 2.0 however is much more capable, fully compatible with solidity, with throughput in the hundreds of TPS. 

Vitally, these smart contracts are now fully interoperable with Hedera's native layer - tokens can be wrapped and moved around with the full attributes of Hedera's native layer including security, finality, speed. 

Their own smart contracts will be able to operate with Besu's performance - a drastic improvement on Ethereum at present which can be continually developed to at least match any advances Eth rolls out.

 They're even buying offsets against the (minimal) electrical cost so you'll be able to say your network is carbon negative.

>The set of shards can be arbitrarily sized, enabling massive parallelization of the consensus process. Notably, this form of parallelization introduces a tunable tradeoff between security and scalability: reducing the number of shards each node covers increases parallelism and scale, but decreases the validator set size of a given shard. This capability allows the system designer to select a minimum threshold of per-shard node coverage that achieves high practical security, while maximizing parallelism and scale by allowing a large number of independent nodes. This is unique to Cerberus and discussed further in the analysis section.

So they can *kinda* place the tradeoff however they want with the way their sharding design works.  But the way they frame it here is the misleading part, and where it reveals that Radix doesn't really solve any new problems because they don't do anything to decrease the overall load of fully verifying the ledger, so sacrificing decentralization as the network utilization increases and compromising its resistance to validator corruption by forcing reliance on third parties.",1642614801.0,1

These are incorrect - processing is also extremely parallel and only happens on the shards related to a transaction.

The Cerberus Infographic series is a great resource that digs into the mechanisms behind Cerberus cross shard consensus and the role the Radix Engine plays to abstract away dealing w/ sharded data from dApps and the developer.

[https://www.radixdlt.com/post/cerberus-infographic-series-chapter-vi](https://www.radixdlt.com/post/cerberus-infographic-series-chapter-vi)

The following are excerpts from Chapters 12 and 13. (It may be easier to open up the pdf versions to find text easily).

&#x200B;

>***Chapter 12 selections - on parallel transactions across shards***  
>  
>Moreover, one of the key concepts that allows this to happen is that of parallel processing. In a future where Radix has scaled to fulfill the DeFi needs of billions of people, the vast majority of transactions will involve completely unrelated substates, shards, and validator sets. Those transactions will be processed entirely in parallel across the vastness of the shardspace without ever being “aware” that the other transactions exist.  
>  
>But not everything can be processed in parallel. There must still be some logic that tells Cerberus when substates are related and must be composed in the same transaction.  
>  
>***Chapter 13 selections - on partial ordering***  
>  
>Therefore ideally, you have a network that’s intelligent enough to only order when it’s absolutely necessary, so that it can process as many transactions as possible in parallel. We therefore want a network that has “partial ordering”  
>  
>....  
>  
>For Radix, that layer of logic is the Radix Engine. It tells Cerberus which substates are related and must be ordered, and which ones are not related and do not need to be ordered and can thus be safely parallelized.  
>  
>So how does the Radix Engine do this?  
>  
>When a transaction is created, it must follow rules stipulated by the Radix Engine. Those rules stipulate that only required substates are used in a transaction, and that when new substates are created, that those are broken down into as many substates as possible, that still make logical sense  
>  
>....  
>  
>Because of the Radix Engine, nodes therefore only need to undertake consensus on the absolutely most minimal set of shards required.  
>  
>If events are not related, they just get processed in parallel, across the entire shardspace, which is so large in size as to be practically infinite.",1642658915.0,4

is people spending large quantities of money* for tokens which represent an image and do little else, a trend which will die out shortly? Hopefully.   

I don't see what problem you think NFTs for music is supposed to solve? You talk about removing middlemen, but NFTs don't seem to provide anything for that that just, letting people buy the song online using a cryptocurrency, doesn't already provide.  

If you think that they could help with DRM for audio in a way that isn't feasible for DRM for images on account of images being screenshot-able, you should know that the same can be done with audio (might be slightly more difficult, but cannot be really protected against.).  

(Also, DRM on music is against freedom)  

I of course agree that being able to more easily create/handle tokens that represent individual intangible things can be useful.

edit: also, if scalability issues are solved (or possibly using a permissioned chain with a large number of known entities, who could be held accountable for any behavior contrary to what the protocol dictates?) then the idea (which some are already pursuing) of using tokens to track what resources went into making products, in order to be assured about where the materials came from, and where the labor and other steps were done, when a manufacturing process involves materials being bought and sold between many companies. Like e.g. where did the oil come from to make this plastic? where was the plastic made? where was the plastic made into parts of shoes? The shoe company presumably doesn't process the oil into plastic themselves, nor the other materials.
Of course, these assurances would only be as trustworthy as those who made them, at least this would make it so they can be tracked. Like, if you are making a cake to sell, you can't generate yourself the assurance that the eggs were from a farm with humanely raised chickens without inventing a made-up farm entity to sign those, which people wouldn't recognize as an existing farm. An actual farm might claim to raise their chickens humanely but not actually do so, and this wouldn't solve that problem, but there are other solutions for that part. This still helps avoid the issue of the cake-maker making up the info about the source of the eggs though. (Because, the problem of checking if a farm exists is even more solved than checking if the farm raises their chickens humanely.)

Another use could be getting certifications that various steps in the process didn't emit large amounts of CO2, or something. Would need certification organizations for that, but still.)",1642553882.0,7

To mint an NFT opensea charges 2.5% of final price , same with rarity and in case of nifty is 5% and 50cents on every secondary sale, This may sound a lot but the thing is that all this gas fee should be there to incentivize the miners, without which all this would never happen.

 Also more users might/might not decrease the gas fee as this would lead to congestion and hence higher the gas fee faster will your nft be minted.

The main way that I have thought about NFTs being useful would be in a subscription/membership based model. Like for example if an exclusive restaurant issued X amount of NFTs that indicated that you held a reoccurring reservation, or just that you were allowed to eat at that particular restaurant. This NFT now not only holds value for the owner of it, but also for the restaurant.

The restaurant would gain an initial investment, and the customer now has an asset that will hopefully appreciate if the restaurant does well. Now if it does appreciate, then the customer could sell the NFT for a profit, the restaurant could then make X percentage on the resale, and would now have record of who the person sold to. This would obviously be a permission based blockchain.

I think that NFTs in particular could be useful for something like this because if it’s a smaller, permission blockchain then it would be easier to track sale and re-sale history. It would also just streamline some processes (re-sale, commission collection, knowing who holds what NFT) that could otherwise be a nuisance, or simply not cost efficient. They could also have an NFT verification system at the restaurant to prevent any forgery. There are definitely other ways to do this outside of just NFTs but this has been the primary way that I see NFTs actually having utility.

Ethereum is like a general purpose decentralised computer where you have a lot of freedom with what you can build on top of it and pay for computation time whether it succeeds or not. Tokens and non-fungible tokens are simply a code standard.

Algorand utilize the account model like Ether. The account model works by removing tokens from one account and adding it to another account in a transaction causing the state of all involved accounts to be a part of the transaction. Instead of being general purpose, it is developed for financial assets and has native support for it. This simplifies some things like asset transfers, has some benefits like fixed cost, and comes with a lot of features and configurability for assets making it suitable for regulated assets.

Cardano use an UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output) model, similar to Bitcoin, instead of an account model. To send a transaction you spend tokens as inputs and create new UTxOs. One address can have several UTxOs so instead of a global state of accounts you have to validate for a transaction, you simply spend a token as an input and create a UTxO belonging to a different address. Cardano doesn't offer feature rich assets like Algorand or decentralised computing like Ethereum but you can accomplish some of the same things by making a Script/UTxO that holds an NFT or Token instead of an account holding it directly.

It is, however, still possible to do addition without making use of this hardware (although this would be a nutty idea).

There are two levels of safeguards. The first is in L2 itself, depending on the L2 technology itself and how it's configured, there are generally rules about what you can and can't do and you will be punished if you do not follow them. This ""punishment"" step is often handled by the L1, and this is the second layer of safeguard. For example, if you are transferring coins through some lightning nodes and one lightning node doesn't transfer the coins as promise, a lightning node can take that info to the L1 chain and say ""hey, look, they promised they'd transfer the coins and they didn't!"" and L1 chain will force the transfer or revert the transfer or whatever the rules require. In short, L2 provides transaction capacity while relying on L1 only for enforcing rules when something goes wrong.

For optimistic rollups, the safeguard is that participants who verify the transactions and submit fraud proofs in case of any fraudulent activity.

For ZK rollups, the layer 1 smart contract verifies that the zero knowledge proofs submitted by the layer 2 operators are valid.

\>  What if an L2 operator pushes an update that sends 10% of every transaction to their own wallet

Transactions have to be signed by the sender, otherwise they are invalid. For zk rollups, this means that an operator trying to insert fraudulent transactions will submit an invalid zero knowledge proof that will be rejected by the layer 1 smart contract. For optimistic rollups, this means that a participant who detects the fraud can submit a fraud proof and be rewarded for it while the malicious operator is penalized.

Some companies allow you to resell digital goods, but only through their storefront and limited to other users who don’t already have the item. Blockchain would allow you to send, sell or burn on any store that uses that blockchain (or send off chain). If your account gets banned or stolen, your purchases are in your wallet and you can take them with you. Again, it’s the ownership that’s important not the uniqueness in this scenario. 

Then there’s interesting applications in the digital publisher world. If you purchased game licenses as NFTs and could use them at any digital store, and buy or resell through them. The store takes a cut to make some money, the publishers get commission and you actually own the game license. But that’s all pipe dream stuff and not likely. An interesting thought experiment. 

Something to remember when people call NFTs worthless is that they are literally tokens similar to any other crypto based token. The main different with ERC-20 and ERC-721 is that ERC-721 has a unique id and metadata. It’s just that 1 ETH = 1 ETH but 1NFT ≠ 1 NFT. If you agree that ERC-20 tokens have value, given that NFTs are a type of token, then they must have value in both scenarios. It’s just that the demand is a lot lower on one side of the fence, right? And rightly so - most owners want to flip and make money and nothing else. 

It’s worth noting that the metadata can be changed (that’s how NFTs reveal) and that they normally link to IPFS, a web api or URL to pull back the digital item. So the image, sound clip, video, digital selling point of an NFT can go offline in some cases. Then what value does it hold? It’s quite a compelling argument against them if the thing you bought for can disappear, but to each their own.",1642347523.0,2

This is not true if NFT dApp uses IPFS for artworks storage, as IPFS is an example of a content-addressable storage technology (the address of a file is only its hash).

The hash of the file on IPFS works differently than checksum. For example, it is not enough to make a very small change to the image, such as changing a single pixel.

The intention of IPFS designers was to protect data against deliberate (editing of a photo, changing a word in the text) altering the data, and not changing it as a result of accident.

First: speculative assets just about always experience price volatility, often because of expected future adoption. This is the way humans behave, and it is rational in this specific way, even though it seems irrational at arms-length. Because this is the way people behave, it should be expected. 

Second: some real artists have made real NFT art. Kevin Abosch is a widely well-regarded artist (one among many), and he has programmed the creation of NFTs as art. Art collectors would say that has value in the art marketplace. 

Third: if you’ve been in crypto for a while, you must know it works exactly this way. ICOs start making money, then you start seeing billions of new ICOs, most of which are absolutely ridiculous. New joke tokens start seeing their tokens boom, then we start seeing more and more joke tokens. 

Fourth: crypto is irrational as part of its ethos. Have you actually talked to people in the crypto space? They make zero sense most of the time, and that is perfect in its own way. Why? Because crypto has always been about doing something so different and so disruptive—so non-sensical—that regular people would finally have a chance at participating in global markets. We don’t trust intellect or reason or people in this context; instead, we trust the technology. The nature of blockchain is that we do not trust any particular individual; instead, we trust the community which sustains the interest in (and maintenance of) the blockchain. 

It is, in a way, a rebellion. All of these sensible, intelligent economic systems have left people feeling as if they are poor and without viable options. If NFTs also leave people poor and without options, well, at least it was done by choice. (“You think I’m stupid and what I’m doing is stupid?

there are those who wanna see cryptocurrency & NFT art shenanigans implode, and I don't necessarily disagree with them entirely, as there's obviously a lotta turd being churned out left and right.

but if there's this much money already poured into certain NFT's, there may be enough of a crowd who bought into the culture of it to keep it alive whether or not there is mass adoption.

might not be an accurate parallel, but I can't see myself ever being interested in buying/ selling fancy watches. It just doesn't appeal to me whatsoever. But there's a large enough cohort that buys into expensive watch collecting, and there are enough buyers and sellers.

I can see NFT art (not speaking about its other uses per se, as I have zero experience with the tech's underpinnings even if I think it's highly likely it'll be used in other ways in the future from smart people who find practical uses for it) having enough players who have dumped big money into it, who understand who's who in the scene, and are able to agree upon worth – even if others can't see it – to keep it afloat.

1) (optional) have the contract which tracks who owns how many of each type of card, allow a feature where you can freeze your ability to transfer the cards for a fixed amount of time  
2) at the start of the match, player’s decks are registered (possibly using some stuff to commit to them without revealing the content of one’s deck to the other player, but still granting them an assurance that one has the tokens for all the cards in one’s deck)  
3) pass back and forth signed messages describing moves and gamestate (and timestamps), in ways that are verifiably valid given the previous state. In order to handle the hidden information of “what cards are in your hand”, use the same techniques which have been used for preventing cheating in [online poker without a central server] .  
4) If any player makes an invalid move, the other player can prove this fact and win (presenting the proof to the smart contract), tell them to make a valid move, or, if they choose, allow the invalid move (if more than 2 players, or if someone other than these two players has an interest in the game, then all players, or a representative for all interested parties, must sign the same message agreeing to accept the invalid move as valid. Alternatively, committing to this not being a possibility can probably be done by using some kind of proof aggregation thing in order to be able to succinctly prove to the contract at the end that all the moves made were valid.)  
5) If a player doesn’t make a move within  a given time limit, then the next player can submit a dispute claim to the smart contract, either where this would count as the other player forfeiting, or skipping their turn, and where the player skipped has a given amount of time during which they can contest this.  
If the player making the claim had previously signed a move which came after the move they claimed wasn’t being made, they are cheating and they lose.  

There is a substantial issue here, where by refusing to make a move, (or, by refusing to send one’s opponent the message describing one’s move), one could force the other player to make their moves on-chain, as you say, which would be problematic.

(Of course, wouldn’t need the entire game state or move description, just a commitment, but still)  

6) finally, final move is verified as valid by the contract (or, if this would be computationally expensive, committed on the smart contract with a claimed result, and only verified by the contract if the claimed result is contested.)

__________

However, a much simpler solution, would be to not even have a smart contract have any transactions during a match at all, where except when cards are being traded/sold/issued/banned/unbanned , the clients simply, check the state of the smart contract, without any transaction happening.  

(Why do you want to be able to cryptographically validate all the moves of a game with a changing card list? That is very complicated with not much benefit.)  

If you want to have betting on the results of the match, just use a 3rd party judge (or panel of judges, depending on the importance of the match).

I don’t think there’s much tendency for judges to cheat or be bribed in big card game tournaments.

And, if there is a standard simulator which encodes the rules of the game, it becomes fairly unambiguous whether a ruling is legitimate. A rules judge who was bribed would lose all reputation as a rules judge.",1642372165.0,1

The current BTC hashrate is ~200 EH/s, so a 51% attack would need ~100 EH/s (100x10^18 H/s).

The Antminer S19 does about 100 TH/s (100x10^12 H/s), so you'd need around a million of them.

In practice that's way more than actually exist, but it's just a thought experiment.

It's a 3kW unit, so each one consumes 24x3 = 72kWh per day.

The cheapest electricity in the US is around 7c per kWh, so at that rate, you'd spend 72x0.07x10^6 = $5.02M / day to maintain a 51% attack.

Of course, that ignores the hardware costs. The retail cost per unit is $11,500, so the hardware alone would be north of $11.5B.

Edit: I just realized that technically it wouldn't be enough to have half the *existing* hashrate, you'd need to *match* the existing hashrate for a 51% attack, so you can double all those figures, and it would be more like $23B upfront + $10M/day.",1642350989.0,14

And possibly emotions of community and identity. Many people still can’t grasp it because they didn’t experience it yet.

I think NFTs are the evolution and combination of meme coins and DeFi. Less abstract, more approachable and more appealing than traditional crypto. I got a free LOOKS drop based on my NFT trading, that is currently staked at 800% APR.

Why would a company bother with that? If a game is networked, it still probably needs servers running to control things, since you can't just trust clients. A more decentralized setup that allows self-hosted or private server managed games with smaller groups is feasible, but then you've still got hosts with control. A p2p setup is possible, but then we're getting into a really limited set of games and a lot more complexity for the net code of a game. If you have your own servers to power the networked aspects of a game, then why not have them vend such data as well?

The reality is that reading data from the blockchain directly is pretty difficult today without running a node on the network.

A potentially better way to achieve similar results to what you described would be for a company to have a fully public dataset available at all times. A simple readonly API for it works just fine. If the company servers ever shut off, the community can fork the last state from it and let that be the source of truth. Different clients can all individually fork off on their own as well.

False. Understanding what makes proof of work the single known way to distribute control without central permission takes people a while. Proof of stake has been around and recognized to be an irrelevant fallacy for most of decade, at least in technically literate circles.

Sustainability of completely permissioned centralized systems doesn't really matter if a permissioned centralized system isn't your goal, and if it is we already had much more efficient systems for achieving that for decades.

Also very few seem to grasp the incentives at play in Proof of Work systems which goes far beyond just hash power.

It's incredibly obvious that proof of stake requires permission of previous stake owner to gain any access to control since tokens have owners and stake owners are literally rewarded for withholding control forever. Needing central permission to control is central control. Not only can proof of stake not be ever classified as decentralized, it's literally incentivizing continuous centralization of control.

Proof of work relies on permissionless external resources (matter/energy) for this reason with unforgeably continuous costs for all making it necessary to give up control to break even. It managed to do something completely unprecedented and unique - to prove something was done in outside world on-chain. There is nothing like it.

This is not the case, proof-of-stake coins are inflationary meaning they print coins each block, in many coins, being a large staker means your coins only keep pace with increasing supply (assuming total value of the coin's market stays the same). Staking rewards are generally linear and proportional to the amount of coin you have, so you don't automatically have all wealth converging into a couple of large addresses.

I see it as AR more than VR. 

Imagine adding ambiance/decorations to a restaurant through AR glasses. 

Imagine Pokemon Go but even more immersive. You can have subsets of people walking around interacting with the Pokemon Go universe, where they see Pokemon around them to catch, while another subset of people are tuned into the Avengers, Harry Potter, or LotR metaverse, with whatever that entails. It’d be like LARPing but to the extreme.

Imagine coming home and your entire house is decorated with NFTs: if you want to rearrange things for decor, instead of having to physically move things, you can just move them virtually. You could have a pet dragon, fountains of lava, unicorns, mermaids, and whatever else you want in your home.

In all these interactions, the physical world would still be present, but you are augmenting what’s already there with things that are only possibly virtually. You can even tie NFTs to physical objects. So, for example, you could have a wand that’s just some stick object in the real world, but because you own the NFT for that wand, you can use that stick in the real world to cast spells in the metaverse.

I don’t know if this vision will ever come to pass, but that’s how I can see the metaverse having the most tangible success, rather than some VR game everyone’s playing.",1642103603.0,30

Yes !!

I'm a long time gamer, started with Pokemon Yellow and up to today's games. I've always been a fan not only of playing but of the whole video game culture and the progression of game play along the years.

I was able to try out a VR game about a year ago, and while I thought it would be boring and not so revolutionary, I was hooked up as soon as I entered the tutorial.

So far I didn't dive deep into it because it's not really my cup of tea, but I was really amazed by the possibilities with a technology and games that are still young in my opinion. The immersion was great and to me it's one of the most important part for many games that are supposed to put you in a character shoes or that let you dive in a specific universe.

 So I want to try it out and I want to follow how things will evolve around that, and I think that great things will be possible, despite the fact that it'll probably won't be used the way it's supposed to be (like how social networks are bringing up so many opportunities but are used in a way that's useless and annoying for most).

i believe that as we go forward with communication and social experiences more apps and sites withove towards the RP style interfaces. i can definitely see Instagram doing this. there are many light weight apps and games that can implement a full metaverse/market system that works for the masses. 

you could go on and on with different use cases and reasons/ideas for metaverses but it all boils down to the original meaning and social interaction. there is this ome show called ""westworld"" thats based on a metaverse type. it's probably actually somewhere in the works as we speak. but that would be large scale.

I would only be interested in the metaverse via VR as a curiosity because I like all thing tech, but it definitely wouldn't become part of my everyday life. 

Whereas I could easily see the general public adopt AR (this is, bringing digital elements into the real world). I would happily wear a pair of glasses and see avatars seeing around on my couch or have a wall turn into shelves of items etc... Not to mention a myriad of other applications for both general use and productivity. It's basically reality enhanced.

I could imagine a future, where you have a device capable of AR and VR that's no more cumbersome than a pair of glasses. At that point I could see the general population adopt the tech.",1642147523.0,1

It’s hard to say in exactly what timeframe it will be considered the new normal but we are slowly underway to making it apart of all our lives.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m a big fan of nature, the outdoors, and doing physical stuff. But the metaverse will unlock the door to doing so many fun and exciting things from the comfort of your home.

Like, travel the world, see the inside of volcanos, skydive, walk on the ledge of sky-high buildings, talk to people all over the world, and just experience things that aren’t easily accessible in life.

We all don’t even have an idea of everything VR is capable of but to say the least, history classes will be able to virtually show their students exactly what the books are talking about, gloves and probably full body suits will be developed to feel things in VR -perhaps even taste things.

Of course, it’s going to be big for gamers but eventually, a lot of us will be going to work in the metaverse. So many people are already working from home. The transition is slowly happening.

# Social interaction

Online gaming is fun for the social interactions, not the P2E hype nor game genres. Social media & media conferencing is good (if anonymousity mantained) & bad (if IRL identity locked on). Why? Me personally more readily open up myself in anonymous & make friends in like, than being around bunches of elderly that always raise issue of respect & so called ""more wise & experiences"" in life (Hence the death of FB). We trancended the era of respect based on age, race, geographical boundaries, social rank; into respect based on open wisdom & ideologies.

# Administration

Regulations is important in any interaction platforms. However, I trust consistent regulation by artificial intelligence more than by human gut feeling. Guess this blockchain not entirely trustless. AI is emotionless (sin-less), almost to the level of gods. Yes, technology improve interconnectivity like shopping & services, but the administration rules (by single authority) the one that most people complain. Also, platform administration exposure to the users also allows more tolerance & understanding why certain platform actions are taken, instead of shear blame of greed or irresponsibility.

# Others factors

I don't understand the need for VR (some people have 3D sickness) & NFT (abstract artistic value that only the crazy rich can apprehend & accept) too. In game items trading might increase game interactivity, but I understand no further than that. For example, minecraft players can play anonymously (though certain regulation by AI is needed) for social & trading for some in game item might solve scam issue, but everything else is clueless to me.",1642309223.0,1

513,CryptoTechnology,Do you genuinely want to use the metaverse?,wballard8,1642102601.0,343,125,0.93,"Never said it should. It should cost as much as people are willing to pay and sell them for. The costs of NFTs currently are outrageous and unrealistic. Current costs are not what a healthy metaverse would look like. Maybe for collector’s items. But who knows. They’ll cost whatever people are willing to buy and sell em for.

For example, if you have an NFT for a wand in the Harry Potter metaverse that allows you to perform certain very powerful spells, and there are only a few copies of that wand in existence, then it makes sense that it would cost a lot. Now, if that same wand existed in another metaverse and did the exact same things but was abundant, people could switch to that metaverse instead and capitalism would take over from there to determine the optimal price. It all depends on how well developed the metaverse is and how much people are willing to spend for a product in one metaverse environment as opposed to another. 

I’d be willing to bet people would spend a lot more for a powerful wand in the official Harry Potter metaverse than for that same wand in a random no-name metaverse. But if that random no-name metaverse has good developers that create a fun, desirable environment, then that wand could then increase in price.

I’m assuming here that there will be multiple metaverses because I find it hard to believe that there will be one metaverse with a monopoly on the entire space, though that’s entirely possible (could see an Apple vs Android metaverse type of thing happening). If there were to be one main metaverse though, you can bet your ass that any items that are scarce will be expensive as hell. 

I imagine there might be one main metaverse platform that will prevail over others, as it has the best design / SDK, and the majority of developers will choose to develop using their platform, similar to Apple with iPhones. Then other competitor metaverse platforms will try to compete and will be around but won’t be as prevalent as the main one for whatever reason (like Android / Windows phones).",1642115034.0,2

IMHO AR is much closer to the next technological leap to gain mass adoption (stable images visible in all lighting conditions) than VR (an untethered headset that’s lightweight and doesn’t cause eye strain/nausea).
In the short term it is more likely that AR will gain broader adoption (esp. with Apple Glasses, Meta’s partnership with Ray Ban, Snap Spectacles, etc.) while VR continues to evolve in its own niche (gaming, entertainment, perhaps some engineering).

Slightly harder to not realize that one isn’t following when reading than when watching.  

The important thing is doing. 

Get an interpreter or compiler installed and working, and get a very simple program to run (this may be copied and pasted, though it may be better to type it in yourself), and then come up with the simplest change you can think of to what you want it to do, that you think you can make, and make that change.
(I imagine you’ve progressed past “Hello, World.”, but if you were at that stage, a decent first thing to try would be “Hello, Wokeman1.”)

 If it doesn’t work, great! You need to be used to that experience. Figure out why.  
If you get an error message you don’t understand, look it up. 
(Though, before you look it up, read it. I mean, if it is many lines long, you don’t need to read the whole thing, but like, you wouldn’t paste the whole thing into google either.). 

Fix the error.
Get it working.  
Make other changes, of increasing difficulty, which require gradually more understanding.

(Fix the errors you encounter each time.
“There are two alternating steps in programming, adding bugs, and removing them.”)

Ask yourself what you can do with the things you’ve understood so far.  
What would be something neat you could do? What can you do with what you’ve learned so far that is potentially surprising that you can do it with that?
What’s something you aren’t quite sure how to accomplish, but you feel like you’re close to being able to?  
What’s the part that’s missing? Break it down.  
Look it up.  

You don’t need to learn all the language features right away, but you should be on the lookout for language features that you aren’t experienced with yet, and which would make things easier/cleaner (or make things possible).  

If it feels like there should be a way to do something, and it would be useful to you, look it up, see if there is a way.

It reminds me of another crazy idea though: create a ledger for debts and let the community build various coexisting gift economy systems on top.

1. The ledger only stores debts between accounts. Zero is the default, `2^64-1` is the maximum.
2. Two accounts can together agree to change the balance between them however they want.
3. Transactions form something like a DAG. Everything is voluntary, so there's little need for the ledger to actually reach consensus. Let other layers worry about it.

Such a system would have no speculative value and would not work as a value transfer mechanism by itself because anyone can create two accounts and set balance between them to `2^64-1`.

However it may work as a mechanism for scaling real world trust, similar to [Hawala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawala) and other [informal value transfer systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_value_transfer_system).

If Alice and Bob have a relationship and Bob and Charlie have a relationship but Alice and Charlie don't want a relationship, then Bob can be an intermediary when Alice wants to sell something to Charlie. Charlie declares debt to Bob, Bob declares debt to Alice, Alice hands over the goods off-chain.

The same process can be automated for chains of any length. The only requirement is that an escrow hands over Alice's goods to Charlie at the same time Charlie confirms the chain trade.

TL;DR: automate debt accounting in a decentralized way. No enforcement, just accounting. Intuitively it feels like something that has no reason not to work.",1642102177.0,1

Say that one week there's a few strains, and the only difference between them is the transaction fee that goes to the miner/staker. One strain is set at 0, one at some other value, and one at a massively high other value. The producers will choose not to support the 0-payout strain, so it'll die. And on the other hand, the consumers won't choose the massively high fee strain, so it'll die. Eventually, consensus will settle on a fair price for the transaction... but even if a consumer for some reason decided to pay the higher price (maybe in exchange for a expected faster transfer?), then that would still get put on the common ledger, just with a different set of rules applied (higher fee being the different rule). Another strain might support some kind of new technology, but might also incur some additional fee. A strain like this might stay around for a long time, being used by people interested in the new tech who want to pay the fee, but ignored by people who aren't interested in using that tech. Either way, all transfers get written to the same master ledger.

And each time a miner or staker supports a strain, they're basically ""voting"" for which strain they want, and the same is true for the people using the chain. Every time they use the service, they vote for which rules they want to govern the blockchain.",1642082069.0,3

&#x200B;

Well I think there's a few reasons.

A) It helps to quickly achieve a viable compromise because there's new forks being made all the time and old ones getting destroyed.

B) It unites these chains into one chain with variable, simultaneous rules. There's no need to pick between btc or ltc in the long term, because you just have coin and choose which rules you want to follow for each exchange. Your coin is immortal, even if the rules that were in governance when you bought it are no longer around.

C) It prevents the exact thing you bring up. Having old tech like btc and classic eth hanging around crowds the space, and puts money in inferior technology. In an ecosystem like the one I propose, a coin like btc would probably have died off a long time ago - only to be replaced with something much better for the producers and consumers. More people get to use better technology, which leads to faster adoption.

D) This produces rule governance like 3rd gen coins always try to achieve, but without actual voting or governance. Even coins like btc, eth, ada still have hard fast rules and ""commands handed down from above"" that neither the producer nor the consumer have any influence over. By distributing power to those who use it, the people who use it can mold the product to fit their interests. The same is true for producers (miners/stakers) who now have some influence over their own life. Agency produces action. Here, the consumer and producer are both given agency and opportunity to shape their own future. And even better, the two are forced to compromise towards a solution which works for both of them.",1642081685.0,-1

This goes against what a blockchain, let alone network is used for.

Programs want just enough data so they can do the computation themselves- not doing computation all the time on the network. Crypto does this because of the protocol which encrypts everything before going on chain.

The premise is that content creators can post content and set a price in FileCoins. The media is encrypted prior to posting to IPFS. Consumers would need to pay for an unlock key. The unlock keys are based on the consumer's public key, therefore can't be shared or reused by others. Now for the ""mining"" part. When someone downloads the content, they are getting it from IPFS, a distributed network of storage providers (seeds). When someone pays for the unlock code, the network scans to see who is seeding the file and gives half the rewards to them and half to the content creator. So, if you want the content for ""free"", you need to seed it to many others. The seeding part is optional, it is a cost in storage and bandwidth to the user. 

Users can also seed other content that they never intend to unlock just to earn FileCoin in order to unlock a file of their choice at a later date. It's also similar to the model of BAT. In BAT, you watch ads to earn BAT then you later spend BAT to view premium content.

As for protections, I think the only thing FileCoin could do is prevent duplicate hashes from being posted. I wouldn't be able to download your media, unlock it, then post it as my own...

I’m imaging your system working something like this: all computers on the network are mining crypto. As the miners run, they allocate their mined coins to various wallets, depend on what  “file” they are mining for. 

Web Page miners are the closest thing to this sort of system currently existing, and they illustrate some of the problems with this system. The problem is that big players can deploy powerful machines, which will be so powerful compared to a consumer device, that the consumer device cannot mine enough coin for it to be worth it. The only way for it to be profitable is if many consumer devices all work together for the benefit of a single person for a very long time - the more powerful the biggest players are, the more small players need to work together, and for longer periods of time. 

This makes it only practical for malware, so that many consumer devices all work together for the benefit of one person, enough to compete with the biggest machines on the network.",1642079434.0,1

Well, maybe it isn’t the best option, if there’s better ways I don’t know about.

The crypto community feels like the type of crowd that would be most interested in it. The inspiration for the idea came from a mix of the Brave Browser and NFTs, so I just assume crypto is the arena in which this idea would work best.

With your suggestion of shasum, does it have the same decentralization and public ledger security that blockchain offers? Does it require or allow any kind of third party involvement to verify? Would it work with cryptocurrency and crypto mining in the same integrated way a blockchain does? Could it be coded to survive copying and peer-to-peer sharing and still work every time the file and/or its copies is played in perpetuity (or at least, as long as the creator stays connected to the system, at which point the mining could either stop or just all go to the viewer)? If so, then maybe it would be the best way to go, but I just assumed blockchain would be the best way to go about something like this.


“Would you use Youtube if every video you watched, arbitrary code by the video creator is run?”

No, but… this wouldn’t be “arbitrary” code. It would be an established system that people agree to use, and the only thing that would change from video to video or creator to creator is the content and/or the wallet the crypto is being sent to. That’s it. Everything else would be as consistent, verifiable and consented to as using a certain video codec to watch a certain video format. What’s “arbitrary” about that?

I’ve already addressed the concern about trojans, malware and piracy, and how they’re already a problem with every form of content distribution we already use.

Nothing’s stopping Disney from putting malware into the code for streaming Disney+ content or downloading a piece of paid content… except for the fact that if they did that, people would find out and nobody would use Disney+ anymore.

Nothing’s stopping people from putting malware into torrent files on The Pirate Bay. And they do! But guess what?! People still take their chances and download pirated torrents every damn day, learning to avoid certain uploaders if they gain a bad reputation, etc… but there’s still tons of trusted content that is clean and accessible, and most importantly FREE at the point of transaction, which is why so many people continue to pirate content. 

That is pretty much all I want. That exact same model as the torrent/piracy system, except in a legitimate, legal system that would ensure the content owners get paid for their work, instead of getting nothing like they currently do from pirated torrents. They’d be the ones uploading their own content, instead of pirates who stole it.

And again, even if pirates do still steal it and try to upload on the same system (which wouldn’t work anyway, because the system wouldn’t verify a duplicate upload from someone else), or on some other platform, what could a pirate offer to people that would make them want to download their copy of the file, instead of the creator’s copy? Nothing. Because the creator’s copy is every bit as free and accessible, with the added advantage of having legitimacy and reputation behind it. If a creator so chose, they could find whoever uploaded the pirated version, because the blockchain would provide a public record of it, and charge them for stealing content, just as you would with any copyright infringement done via today’s technology. The public record of the blockchain would itself be a disincentive to pirate, on top of there already being less of an incentive to pirate already-free-and-accessible content. For the same reason most Youtubers don’t have to worry about their content being pirated, the content already being free tends to nip the desire for a pirated version in the bud. People pirate Netflix stuff, though, because Netflix has a subscription paywall. This is why the no-cost-to-the-consumer part is so important.

“Do you know about the log4j exploit? It’s similar in that this would open a window to remote code execution.”

Okay, I get that this is a potential risk, but again… why is that different for this idea than it already is anything and everything that people download and use on their computers? How is it so much more of a concern for this than it is for, say, downloading and running a node for the PI Network, for example, or any other blockchain? How is it more of a risk than what a lot of creators already do by selling a downloadable MP4 through their website?

I mean, is this not what blockchain technology is all about? A system of verification via nodes on a network of computers? The technology/coding expertise needed to figure how to make it as secure as possible would be a given in developing this idea, but I feel like a lot of that work has already been done in blockchains of various uses. What you’re asking me is essentially the same as asking why Bitcoin should be trusted. Does installing a Bitcoin wallet and transferring Bitcoin to it not open these same type of concerns? If not, why not? If so, why doesn’t it invalidate mining or storing Bitcoin, but it invalidates watching videos via the same type of system?

708,CryptoTechnology,Would this be possible?,AWS-77,1641991253.0,175,15,0.63,"Well yeah, the idea is entirely based on the collective mining power of as many viewers as you can get. The consumers would be completely aware of this and agree to it and everything, so I don't know why you're characterizing it as ""malware"". Malware is malware because it's ""malicious"", as in people don't want it in their computers because it does damage or slows things down and often they don't even know about it or can't get rid of it. This wouldn't be anything like that, so how is it malware?

The consumer would download the file and when they open it, they're met with a dialog box that says something like ""Playing this file will run a crypto-miner for the duration of the content. Do you consent?"" ... if they don't, they don't do it. If they do, they click Yes, and the file checks with the system to verify the file is legit and untampered with, passes copyright checks, etc, and then plays it. The miner runs in tandem with the playing of the file, so imagine you make a 10-minute video, so 10-minutes of mining time per view, and get as much as 1000 viewers to view it... that's 10,000 minutes of mining time on your video. Now imagine you get a million views. A hundred million views. A billion views. Like I said, it wouldn't have to be much mined per view for it to add up to a big sum for the creator. If you don't get many views, you don't get many rewards, but what else is new in the world of content monetization?

The concern about people with more powerful machines hogging all the rewards doesn't seem relevant, when the rewards are going to the creator anyway, from wherever they happen to be when they're mined. I'd think that would actually discourage people from lending more processing power than they would need to just to get the video to play, because there'd be no incentive for them to if they're not getting the rewards. They just want the video to play. You could set like a base minimum amount of processing power that's required to verify the file and ensure a base amount of mining, and then add the option to allow more processing power than that, if you wanted, which would raise the collective mining power and generate more rewards for the creator per view, so it'd be an act of generosity on the viewer's behalf to donate their processing power, which I'd imagine people would do if they really like a creator (could even include a tipping option as well if they want to be even more generous). As long as the minimum is an amount that the average iPhone could do (which, come on, those things are getting pretty impressively powerful now and only increasing going forward), then it would be enough to make the system work and get some amount of mining rewards out of each view. If the person's device isn't powerful enough to even reach the minimum, then it would have to be a pretty old device and they should accept the consequences of their lagging on keeping up with technology, the same as if your old phone doesn't support a new app or OS.

So looking at it this way, if the average processing power across all viewers' devices was enough to generate, say, a cent's worth of crypto for about 10 minutes of viewing, then if you got a million views, you'd have a thousand bucks for 1 million views on a 10 minute video. The same for half a million views on a 20 minute video and so forth. Feature films could generate around $120,000 from a million views at that rate. Now imagine the value of the cryptocurrecy goes up to make it so you're mining $1 worth for 10 minutes of viewing. A 2-hour movie now makes $12 million from only 1 million views. A 3-hour movie makes $18 million. Now imagine you're Hollywood, where you can attract tens of millions or hundreds of millions of viewers with movies that people will watch again and again for years to come... think major studios and rich filmmakers might be interested in investing at this point? Crypto price goes up, rewards go up... so on and so on.

Maybe those amounts are overly-optimistic, but it would all depend on how well the cryptocurrecy's price does, and like I said, if the system attracted the attention of the likes of Hollywood, Bollywood, the music industry, television studios, news media, etc... that price could get pretty damn high with not a lot of mining needed per view to generate substantial rewards from mass amounts of views.",1642088757.0,1

&#x200B;

>The inspiration for the idea came from a mix of the Brave Browser and NFTs, so I just assume crypto is the arena in which this idea would work best.

The basic attention token (BAT) is pretty much as close as a solution creators can get to getting paid in a safe and reliable way for their content. It trades off reliance to third party advertisers to user safety and ease of use. In a sense, your proposed idea is similar to brave but with this balance tweaked.

&#x200B;

>With your suggestion of shasum, does it have the same decentralization and public ledger security that blockchain offers?

shasum is a checksum  program that can produce a deterministic hash string given the same input. This could be used in combination with digital signatures to verify that the file contents + signature is valid making files linked to their original creator as long as the file and signature have not been modified. This is not hard to implement using existing code libraries. It is decentralized (trustless) in that the user is able to verify for themselves that a file is untampered. This would just be a technique that could be integrated into the entire ecosystem but does not offer middle man less content payments.

&#x200B;

>What’s “arbitrary” about that?

It's arbitrary in that it would be different for each file. Each file/content creator would have to set their own crypto mining script to run. And people with bad intent can do much worse than having a crypto miner run while the file is open.

&#x200B;

>And again, even if pirates do still steal it and try to upload on the same system (which wouldn’t work anyway, because the system wouldn’t verify a duplicate upload from someone else)

Your file system will still use existing file formats such as mp4 for videos and mp3 for audio under the layer of abstraction the new format provides. People can and definitely will extract the underlying content though reverse engineering or what not to extract the raw content. Then these files can be wrapped in your new file again but with the pirate's payout address.

&#x200B;

>what could a pirate offer to people that would make them want to download their copy of the file, instead of the creator’s copy?

The pirate's copy is there to deceive unsuspecting people and ""steal"" views from the original creator.

&#x200B;

>If a creator so chose, they could find whoever uploaded the pirated version, because the blockchain would provide a public record of it, and charge them for stealing content, just as you would with any copyright infringement done via today’s technology.

You seem to want the files tracked via blockchain. But what is the merit in tracking static files on a decentralised server? Again, blockchain is overkill for your idea. Also, just from the nature of blockchain and international law, the creator won't be able to find out who the pirates are and take them to court. A content publisher, whether original or pirate, will always just be a public key represented on the blockchain making it impossible to find out who owns the public key.

&#x200B;

>why is that different for this idea than it already is anything and everything that people download and use on their computers?

Because the file type you have proposed is an EXECUTABLE script/program with attached content. People go around torrenting movies off the internet because the file format is just a multimedia storage dump where no code is executed. A crypto miner is fundamentally a script that runs on a computer where as a MP4 file is a bunch of data that is interpreted and displayed by a MP4 player. It has no other capabilities that storing data.

&#x200B;

>Does installing a Bitcoin wallet and transferring Bitcoin to it not open these same type of concerns?

Because Bitcoin wallets don't execute crypto miners or any other arbitrarily set code. Your system would be similar to having bitcoin wallets that allow people to send code fragments to each other and then having those fragments executed on the recipients machine when they open their wallet.

&#x200B;

>All that’s different is the code would contain the data that makes up a video instead of a Bitcoin token

That's what you are misunderstand. When you make or receive a bitcoin transaction, no code is executed on your local hardware where as with your system, a crypto miner, which is CODE, is executed on your machine. The difference being, the file affects your machine where as a bitcoin transaction cannot. There cannot be a zero trust model going on when you have to trust the content creator that they haven't included malicious code in their content.

&#x200B;

I don't even think the piracy potential of your system is even an issue. It's just a side effect. The biggest issue is that the model allows for scripts/code to be executed on user's machines and the single point of trust is the file uploader. This is  a fundamental flaw that I would face if I was tasked with creating such a system. I'm sure there are smarter people who can come up with ideas to make middle-man less content payment systems or better yet implement your system in a way that is safe for users, but I, and many people in this thread, don't seem to think that is possible.",1642163412.0,1

In short: it’s a good idea, it’s just that nobody has been able to figure out how to actually do it in practice. 

As I see it, the crux of the problem is wrapped up with block rewards. Let’s start with blockchains that have constant block rewards - meaning, the amount of crypto mined per block is constant no matter how many people are mining.  The amount of crypto you mine is therefore approximately proportionate to the _fraction_ of total compute power your device has compared to the compute power of the rest of the computers in the network combined. With Bitcoin, this means that if you mine on a cellphone for a hundred years, you won’t make a single penny (or something on that scale). 

On the other hand, let’s say your blockchain has variable rewards, so that more mining means more crypto created per block. Here, you face a different problem: inflation of the coin. If the rate of inflation goes up as mining increases, the value of the coin may plummet. I won’t matter if it means that low powered devices are able to mine at least a small number of coins, because those coins will have so little value it wont matter.

Here’s what would happen in the system your imagining: people would mine crypto for themselves by consuming the content that they create, and they would do this with powerful machines.  (Nobody has been able to figure out a way of preventing this - for instance, it’s not very difficult make a single powerful machine appear like many smaller machines, so you couldn’t just make a rule preventing large machines) This would drive down the amount of crypto that could be mined on consumer devices - because it’s not about how powerful they are, it’s about how powerful they are _compared to the other miners_. 

I see how you’re trying to construct this system, so that collectively lots of people watching the same video will end up mining enough coin to be worth it together. So far, nobody has been able to figure out the economics of this well enough to make this actually work in practice. In the best case, a small amount of crypto would be mined for videos that go viral, most crypto goes to miners watching their own videos, and every other video would get zero crypto. 

This is why I said it’s well suited for malware. I’m not saying that your imagining malware, I’m just saying that it does actually generate money efficiently in a malware context. With malware, you’d gets lots of peoples devices all mining for you for long periods of time- and this would function similar to the “watching your own videos” scenario I described, which is how most coins would be mined. 

All that being said - it’s still a nice idea! It’s just that there are difficult problems that nobody has been able to solve yet that need to be solved for it to work.",1642111025.0,1

Nobody would be able to repost content on the system or post copyrighted material they don’t own without it being treated the exact same way Youtube would treat it.

The verification would make it so that every file downloaded from a creator’s upload would need to be verified that it matches the original upload, or it won’t play. If someone tries to repost it on the system to monetize it themselves and cut out the creator… the system would detect that upload’s content as matching the content of the original upload, the same way Youtube’s algorithm detects and blocks copyrighted material. The same would go for posting copyrighted material that’s not on the system, where the owners of the copyright in question would have the same recourse they currently have with Youtube. Whatever the copyright laws in the country in question are, they would apply and be enforceable by the system’s algorithms.

I figured this all would have been clear when I said that the files need to be verified to work. It’s part of the reason I assume blockchain technology would work, because it’s all about transactions being approved by verification of authenticity in a decentralized peer-to-peer network.

I feel like you’re still kinda missing the point of the collective mining and the fact that the rewards go to the creator, not the people doing the mining. It doesn’t matter if a person with a cellphone doesn’t have enough power to ever get rewards… as long as they’re contributing even a tiny bit to the collective mining power, then that’s all that matters. To the creator, it doesn’t matter if the rewards are coming from a million people or 1 guy with a supercomputer… it’s all the same to the creator. The point of having a large pool of consumers viewing the content is to spread that around as much as possible, and wherever the balance falls in terms of who’s doing the most mining, then so be it. It’s not a competition between the miners like it is when they’re competing for the rewards, because they’re all just working together to reward the creator. I think that requires a fundamentally different way of thinking about it compared to normal crypto mining, and I’m not sure you or anyone else here is really grasping that aspect of it. If you’re saying that no current blockchain technology could work this way, then I guess I am actually suggesting an evolution of the technology that would require a whole new type of collective mining method to be developed. And yes, I realize that’s a big ask.


The issue of people just viewing their own content to reward themselves… again, so be it, if that happens. I don’t think that would prevent them from still contributing a substantial amount to other creators, because as much as I personally love watching my own content (I made it the way I like it, after all!)… I can’t spend ALL my time watching my own content. Sooner or later, I’m gonna wanna watch some other people’s shit. I’m gonna wanna throw on a movie or tv show or any of the type of content I’m interested in. Nobody would ever JUST watch their own content and NEVER anybody else’s. I mean, do current filmmakers who have movies on Netflix just stream their own shit all day long to rack up views on it so Netflix pays them more? Probably not. And even if they did, I don’t think that’s necessarily a problem at all. In the case of a blockchain, as long as they’re running the node, they would still be contributing to powering the blockchain with their mining, so even if they’re just watching their own content, they wouldn’t just be free-loading.

On the issue of inflation, I do see that being a potential problem, but not necessarily any more so than any cryptocurrency that isn’t hard-capped on supply like Bitcoin is (Ethereum or Doge, for instance). Maybe it could be hard-capped and still work somehow? But I figure not really, once all the coins are mined. Ideally, it wouldn’t be capped, so it can go on in perpetuity, and the creators with a vested interest in keeping the price up would keep re-investing some of their profits back into the system. And again, just imagine how much investment capital would be pumped into it if the likes of Hollywood et al got on board. I think that would overcome inflation for a pretty good while at least. I mean, for example, how long do we think Ethereum can stay valuable enough without a hard-cap to prevent inflation? For that matter, how long do we think fiat currency can remain valuable enough to keep the economy functioning with all this inflation going on? It’s a widespread problem, so again, if other systems that face these same problems have managed to work well enough for as long as they have and/or will… this system could too.

And finally, yes, I certainly understand this is all tough stuff to figure out and make work, but that’s why I came here to see what the actual obstacles are.

Antivir software: all antivit software has a fundamental flaw, it can only find already known malware, it is mathematical impossible to find out what a pice of code does(called the halting problem).

Walled garden: this defeats the whole idea of crypto and blockchain, if you have a central authority like apple(the classic example for a walled garden) they can just give out coins, you dont need to form consent between individuals anymore. You just invented a central bank/company that sells virtual coins and allows its users to interact with their API.

720,CryptoTechnology,2 questions about blockchain supply chains?,The_GodKing,1641897819.0,68,13,0.94,"This article is useful for understanding the applications of blockchains for supply chains:

https://hbr.org/amp/2020/05/building-a-transparent-supply-chain

Blockchain technology has a few beneficial characteristics that you mentioned: immutability, transparency, and decentralization. However, private rather than public blockchains can be designed in a centralized way that still utilizes the other benefits. This is what IBM, Walmart, and some other companies are doing for supply chain blockchain tech. Some highlights from the article:

“A blockchain is valuable partly because it comprises a chronological string of blocks integrating all three types of flows in the transaction and captures details that aren’t recorded in a financial-ledger system. Moreover, each block is encrypted and distributed to all participants, who maintain their own copies of the blockchain. Thanks to these features, the blockchain provides a complete, trustworthy, and tamperproof audit trail of the three categories of activities in the supply chain.”

“Blockchain thus greatly reduces, if not eliminates, the kind of execution, traceability, and coordination problems that we’ve discussed. Since participants have their own individual copies of the blockchain, each party can review the status of a transaction, identify errors, and hold counterparties responsible for their actions. No participant can overwrite past data because doing so would entail having to rewrite all subsequent blocks on all shared copies of the blockchain.”",1641953053.0,8

NFTs are, as you said, an entry in a database. By themselves, they are useless, just as useless as a monkey picture, a ""plot of land"" in a game that never launches, etc.

But your house deed, or your car registration are also a registries in a database somewhere...  the difference is the correct people pay attention to that database entry, and act accordingly.

NFTs are the same... by themselves they are just a piece of information saying ""bob owns XYZ"", but if a government minted then, and recognized the NFT as the deed to your house, then it's a deed. If a sports company mints them, and recognizes them as a valid ticket, then it's a ticket. If EA recognizes that NFT as your legendary pink camo skin, then the NFT IS a pink camo skin.

Making normal ""database entries"" into NFT has some disadvantages. For example, manipulating them (buying, selling, minting) has an inherent network cost to it. They are slower than printing a paper ticket, or saving a database record to a centralized database, etc.

They also have advantages: They are in a public space so they can be verified (travel companies can't overbook a plane without it being noticed, EA can't mint more than 100 of the ""Only 100 limited edition Messi shirt""), also, you can trade or sell the NFT to whoever you want (when you get bored of that pink camo skin for example), also, no-one needs to know WHO you are, whoever can cryptographically prove they own the NFT ""own"" the asset the NFT represents.",1641815172.0,19

743,CryptoTechnology,Giving life to NFT's,AnonymousOceanStorm,1641810292.0,214,48,0.79,"Some comments:

1. NFTs are tokens, not the art. You are not paying to obtaint the artefact, you are paying to be registered as the token-owner.

2. Blockchains have limited and costly storage, whereas artworks have presumably high definition preferences. So art is not stored on the chain. Instead, a pointer to a URL is stored. Presumably that contains the requisite art, but if the server goes down/stops serving it/serves something else then you won't find your chosen artwork there, you'll find a 404 or whatever.

3. Blockchains are deterministic - a block has to be verified, which means everyone verifying it has to reach the same conclusion about the resulting block.  In some chains (Blockchain, Ethereum) the entity mining a block is unknown, so you can have future information which isn't known until the block begins to be mined, but you can't insert randomness inside the block in any chain I've seen.

4. As blocks have to be verified, everyone can run the algorithm to work out what the block contains. So even if you did store the artefact on chain, everyone can check that the new version of the artefact is correct, so they can also generate it.

5. Blockchains solve one specific problem: that in a digital era where all information is easily perfectly copied, it is hard to construct a system that enforces scarcity. So NFTs are tokens which are constructed to be scarce, in as much as you need the owner's permission to modify the ledger entry. Trying to use this system to create a non-copyable or non-replicable artefact misses the point; artefacts are assumed to be replicated perfectly.

6. Suppose you wanted to create such a system to create a time-dependent artefact, e.g. it has the date in the corner which is updated every day, and you still want this on the chain because you want that time-dependence to be independent of any centralized image server. This would mean that at least one block of the chain every day has to include the regeneration of your image, and you would have to pay the gas fees for this regeneration, every time.

To be honest, this goes against the point of a distributed ledger - if you want to prove you're the current owner of the token, you point to the public ledger and let people check for themselves.

If you want to create an artefactory which combines your artefact with the date and your ownership proof, then that might be a fun service, but it's one that would exist parallel to the ledger, not on it or generated by it.",1641838598.0,1

With the cooperation of social platforms, embedded data in the images actually allow automated enforcement regarding situations where a person's work is absent of credit or if it's being incorrectly credited. Social platforms like twitter or Pinterest, if willing to implement such a tool, simply looks for the embedded data and either denies an upload if it doesn't possess it, automatically credits creator/owner once it's recognized, or even exposes whether or not there are duplicates of said image on several different NFT chains and call attention to conflicts.

Ideally, uploading images on the internet that \*don't\* possess embedded data or NFT registration would flag that content as public whereas interested parties who do care about ownership of their digital work would make sure to register it before it goes out to the wider internet.

Even attempting to upload a screen shot of an image that is already registered, in an effort to obliterate the embedded data, can be cross-referenced via image search and denied being uploaded outright or even have the data re-embedded before it hits anyone's dashboard.

My gut feeling is no, because blockchains in general and autonomous contract chains like Ethereum in particular act like one collectively-run, slow computer. So requiring that it does a computation so unreasonably hard that no one could get to the answer quicker seems not to fit.

It might be possible with a function as you describe, in that the verification doesn't have to be as slow, but you still require the computation to be performed by every mining node, and if the computation wasn't contained and continued in every block, then it could be outpaced. 

None of this improves the energy wastage argument against PoW chains.

Ultimately assuming that some function's eventual output can't be predicted by someone out there with a faster computer ignores the reality that there are some people out there with faster computers. So you'd have to incentivise them to mine the block and expect this endlessly churning artefact to cost you a lot in arbitrary computation.",1641948438.0,1

788,CryptoTechnology,Giving life to NFT's,AnonymousOceanStorm,1641810292.0,214,48,0.79,"ah, no, the hard computation isn't done by miners. It is done by one person (or, at most a handful of people) with a fast computer, who then makes a transaction where they submit the result of the computation, and then the smart contract (which is run by all people who are running a node that actually, like, checks that blocks make sense) does the easy verification that the result is correct, and then rewards them (with a small reward) for providing it with the computation.  

We aren't trying to get the chain to do a computation faster than anyone else.  
That would indeed be impossible, as you say.  

We are trying to ensure that a computation can't be done before a certain time, and that we get the result not too long after that time.  

(The reason that only a few people would be doing the computation, is because only one person will get a reward for doing it, and if you think someone else has already started running it, there's basically no reason to start running it yourself unless you think there's a good chance that they will for some reason not finish it (and submit it) as quickly as you can, despite them starting earlier.)",1641949293.0,1

They blame the GPU shortage on miners and that's the reality, I know people who own tens of them for mining while GPUs are pretty much impossible to find. Nvidia released a low hash rate version of their cards to counteract that, people rushed to find ways to unlock them.

Bitcoin IS bad for the environment, it uses 0.5% of our energy production to manage less than a trillion in funds, the whole traditional financial system uses 2.5% for quadrillions in funds. A decentralized solution will always be inefficient, all the transactions executed on Bitcoin's network don't require multiple computers to do them, my home computer can execute more operations per second than the network allows, but decentralization means that you need at the very least two computers to run the network. That's not even talking about the resources required for the hardware to mine that ends up being pretty much impossible to recycle or the increase in electricity requirements which lead to more infrastructure being built to keep an overhead and these infrastructures are also made of materials that can't be recycled and that are extracted in non ecological ways...

Crypto is a speculative asset, if the technology was what's important then only stable coins would be required, instead it's a zero sum game of people trying to make profit at the expense of others and in the end someone's going to buy at the final ATH and they'll never make their money back.

Maybe it's you being stuck in an echo chamber and creating a post to tell us you intentionally make sure you won't be exposed to diverging opinions.

This is the second massive dip since crypto went truly mainstream. You've now got all of the people that think they timed the market now holding all of the bags.

That, and crypto (and nfts) have yet to come up with a viable, unique use case. People are finding out that crypto prices change with the wind (and public sentiment) just like stocks, but do not have anywhere near the amount of consumer protections that stock trading has (nor do they have the theoretical tether to a real entity).

Crypto, so far, has been riding a wave of popularity, which has directly been driving the price - so this becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. This is often why people call it a ponzi scheme. I think many people are now sick of the coordinated mass pump and dump schemes, the miners causing a gpu shortage, and the huge amount of wash sales pumping prices, also.

As for the sub reactions, /r/technology is a default sub. Who knows what percentage of reddit is now bots/astroturfing accounts, and what percentage is actual public opinion.

I'm doing this since 2021 Jan, managed to stack 5K at some point that 5K went up almost 10K. I'm stacking everything and just from passive income I got 200$.

I sometimes go on a website for people who are learning English and want to improve their conversational skills. There aren't a whole lot of native speakers on that site, so they tend to appreciate it when they get to talk to someone from an English-speaking country, plus it's fun to hang out.

One day while I was on there, I sort of befriended a guy in his mid 20s from India. As I got to know him better, he told me this whole story about how he lied to his dad and told him he'd spent the last year or two saving up a large sum of money so that he'd be proud of him. The guy mentioned the amount he told his dad he'd saved, so I typed it into a converter and it turned out to be something like $250 USD.

Hearing first-hand that to someone out there, $250 could be a large enough sum of money for him to *lie* to his parents about to make them *proud*, well it kind of changed my perspective on the whole thing.",1643028373.0,5

I am CAD, 56, one spring-summer-fall (year = 1985-ish)  when I was fresh out of high school. I landed a seasonal job, did well,  stuck with it.  All finished up just approaching xmas.  One of the few times my Dad talked to me sober, a great memory.  He said good job and so forth, then added, can you buy yourself  a new car ? No!!!, (he knew I could not) he said that's inflation right there, Dad continues, when I was your age, I did exactly what you did out of highschool, worked those 3 seasons, stayed with it, we did about the same.  Same hours, pay rate, etc ... Dad said, AND I quote here and saw his pictures of him and his car ... "" I bought my first brand new car at the end of that season (1957 late fall) with cash, and had enough left over to get  through the winter if he kept spending carefully, and got a girlfriend and had some fun (Dad was 20 yrs old, bought a 57 chevy brand new.)...he then said no way in hell you can do that, it will take you another year to save for down payment and then try to get approved for a loan?? If yes on loan which is unlikely -, then 5 years to pay off the car and it sure won't be a 56 chevy!!!  That is a huge difference in only one generation.  I was 19 or 20 and there is no fukin way I coudlve even thought about a new car, barely kept my piece of shit running to get to work, nor did I ever even think of a new car until he said that.  I was 45 when I finally drove the one and only new vehicle off of a lot,  new GMC pickup, and I regretted it badly.  So, That is inflation perfectly demonstrated over 1 generation, 27 years between me and Dad in age.  And we as i society are still are going to end up with a collapsed economy becuz of banks and gov and greed, extreme carelessness / because of banks, intentionally mismanaged our resources for their benefit.  This was our resource, our cash system, ""OUR = ALL OF US!/SOCIETY!"".  This fact is not common knowledge and people as a group accept this blatant theft, and this theft is openly called inflation....  ... we should be really damned angry ... but most don't know nor appreciate the fuckery done, and it is a tough truth and one that hurts!!!  Try to spread that  news and information is like handing out free syphilis .. COME GET YOUR FREE SYPHILIS< SYPHILIS HERE - FREE!!!  nobody wants that !!!   Anyway, I say , do not burn down our cities, simply use crypto as much as you can for tiny things at first, let ppl get used to it, make it known and common, ease into it so the system doesn't collapse overnight.  take the money out of gov and banks and put it back in our hands ... that is the very last thing those mofo banks and politicians would want. that's is the worst thing we could do to them, make it so all that money they stole and tricked away from us, is worth fuck all, just like they made it.  stop filing / paying taxes and sending in accurate  tax docs, don't carry identification, barter with neighbors, we can kill them banks and power hungry assholes pretty quick,I bet quicker than the 27 yrs of time when they pulled the inflationary switcheroo on me and my Dad.  Sry this is so long. I am fukin pissed, this ain't the first guy the banks done this to, and if my bank did that ..... holy  shit I would be so furious.   huh -  there's some loud assshole fekin knocking pounding at my door, they yelling police something, something .. hang o     'oi'vboinbif'afnb bjLJKBN p;m cvfgfh544545gggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggbvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvffffffffffffffffffffffffffvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv      hhhhhh       nnnnnn     bbbbb",1643087045.0,2

Everyone hates KYC right, well somewhere there is a regulator that designed the KYC checks that your bank have to perform on their account holders, and the some of those sets of regs contain expected standards, review processes, penalties for failure on the part of the bank etc.       


Your bank has decided that it is far too much cost and effort to ensure that any customers that deal with crypto do so ""legally"" (in the eyes of the regs they follow) so fuck it, they'll switch it off.

I mean you reached the right conclusion with the wrong math but yeah we agree there.

Except gambling is an addictive and destructive habit and would make one much more likely to lose it all sooner or later just by virtue of starting it and most of the time the odds are massively worse as their clients aren't all collectively gambling on a single 50/50, most gambles have much much worse odds than that and nothing guarantees they will have the winners on their sheets nor that the winners won't keep going until they get wrecked. The easier explanation is that crypto directly conflicts with their interests.

I could go out and spend all my paycheck on lottery tickets and bank wouldn't do a thing about that either, which is about as good as burning money, hell the same bank that forbids transactions to CEXs also allows me to put money in shit like IQ option which is a garbage degenerate leverage trading app (there's literally only leverage positions at a minimum of X3 with some going as high as x100), it even has some ""cryptos"" in it, they allow me to buy on etoro as well, what do both of these have in common? In neither I can actually get the keys to any of that ""crypto"", etoro only offers CFDs (at least in my country).

1816,CryptoCurrency,My lovely bank cares so much about me (!),OberynMartell94,1643068074.0,256,501,0.91,"Correct. A bank does not care what you do with your money so long as what you do doesn't effect the bank. Nor should it. 

A bank's job is to safely hold your money and to give it to you on demand.

Separately, banks protect themselves from losses. And one way they protect themselves is by having policies that prevent the bank from suffering large losses.

I don't think you understand sports betting if you think that the odds of winning are much worse than 50/50. If the Chargers are playing the Rams one team will win and one will lose. The odds will be reasonably close to 50/50. Since individuals will bet on different teams, a bank will not have a scenario where all of its customers chose the losing team.

This is brutal for those who rely upon turning quick profits in crypto. Yet, this is legit the ideal situation for those with the resources and resolve to HODL for a very long time.

(Please, don't dig in if this doesn't apply to you). 

I guess I'd follow the above by saying this - it's been often mentioned in this sub and basically stands as a foundational tenet in crypto and for really any investment: INVEST ONLY THAT WHICH YOU CAN LOSE IN THE EVENT SHIT TANKS. As such, though it sucks to see many bleeding out in this crash, it stands to say that crypto is a damn volatile and risky-af investment vehicle.

If you haven't stockpiled 6 months of diapers, clothing,  and formula by now, you're doing it wrong. Seriously. 

My baby just turned 6 months old 2 days ago.  I stockpiled what I thought was 6 months worth of diapers around the 3rd or 4th month of my wife's pregnancy (I've probably still got another 4 months worth, realistically) and about 20 of the largest containers of formula I could find. My wife and I were clothes shopping every weekend at inexpensive places. We decked out the nursery by 6 our 7 months into the pregnancy. 

If you buy everything you need up front and just ride it out, you'll be shocked at how cheap babies are. I don't think I've spent a dime on baby stuff since she was born with the exception of the odd toy or occasional ""oh shit, we left the bottle at home"" emergency.",1643063674.0,3

If you’ve been in crypto since 2013 or 2017, these waves are nothing new.

If you’re new to crypto, zoom out. Broaden your horizon. Start seeing this as a long term play. Anything worthwhile takes time, discipline, and a lot of patience. Take some time to work on yourself. How you act or react is all psychological, so build that strength.

The ones panicking are those that are over-leveraged or put everything on the line in hopes of making a “quick” buck. If you fall into this camp, you’ll have learned a hard lesson, but it will be a worthwhile one, and it will make you better.

I view BTC and ETH both as a rite of passage for anyone new entering into this market even buying it from a centralized exchange like coinbase/kraken/binance are fine because they are actually newbies friendly.

I use to look at charts and read on crypto projects fundamentals all day long.

Nowadays I'm fully invested in time, capital and efforts to promote Cosmos and its ecosystem.

My reasonings:

* Investing in my time -> Cosmos and most of its ecosystem are proud with their 0 private sale, 0 private marketing and 0 ICO
* Investing in capital -> Fully invested 80% of my capital in Cosmos, Juno, Osmosis, Akash, a bit of a disclaimer I was airdropped Juno and Osmo but I bought an equivalent if not more amount of the number of tokens I received from the airdrop
* Investing in efforts -> Cosmos and Juno, especially Juno Network holders are really proud of its grass-roots movements. All the cutting edge tools like DAO\_DAO, JunoSwapDex, JunoMint, JunoDrop are all built by the dev community as a community. I'm not a developer thus the only thing I can do is write.

If you are new to Cosmos, I would like to recommend you to start reading/listening/watching about Juno Network, then start into other ecosystems like Osmosis, Stargaze, etc..",1643079606.0,2

There is no asset that is immune to market manipulation.  If you hold alot of it, then you have an impact on the price.

Let me tell you a story. There was a man named [Mansa Musa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansa_Musa). The king of Timbuktu. Often referred to as the wealthiest person in history. He was largest producer of gold in the world at the time. 

He once made a pilgrimage to Mecca. On his way to Mecca, he spent so lavishly that it literally caused a currency crisis. Goods and services inflated drastically. It also created a 10 year gold recession.

On his way back, he realized his mistake. He then proceeded to borrow all of the gold he could carry from money lenders in Cairo at a high interest. We're talking 60,000 people carrying gold. Camels. Horses.

The BTC increase in value during 2012 -2013 was diven by fraudulent trading, there [have been reserch papers completed on this.](https://tylermoore.utulsa.edu/jme17.pdf)

The same thing happened again in 2017. Because of the blockchain you can actually figure this out by looking at the block chain reccords, and that is what people did:

[A single anonymous market manipulator caused bitcoin to top $20,000](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/04/study-single-anonymous-market-manipulator-pushed-bitcoin-to-20000.html).

[Studies show that 95% of Bitcoin trades are fake](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/22/majority-of-bitcoin-trading-is-a-hoax-new-study-finds.html)

>The analysis showed that “substantially all of the volume” reported on 71 out of the 81 exchanges was wash trading, a term that describes a person simultaneously selling and buying the same stock, or bitcoin in this case, to create the appearance of activity in the market. In other words, it’s not real.

Any one can look at the block chain and so any one can see that this is true. 

In the rush for something new people tend to foget that, despite its glaring flaws, we have rules and regulations in the modern system for a reason. It was better than what came before.

It is inadequate to value a company because the market price on which it is based does not necessarily reflect how much a piece of the business is worth. Shares are often over- or undervalued by the market, meaning the market price determines only how much the market is willing to pay for its shares.

You mean the guy who reads charts like they are tea leaves and just makes guesses based on what the squiggles did before?  

Not an attack on you OP, but this sub constantly says ""he does pretty good work.""  However it's literally all just him guessing what it might do based on overlying charts from before and saying.. ya if you believe this then this is reasonable.  Which of course is based on absolutley nothing.

To me it's like someone saying ""Last time it was raining I pulled out my umbrella and 5 minutes later it stopped raining.  So now that it's raining again I have pulled out my umbrella, however here we are an hour later and it's still raining.  So if you believe in rainstorms getting longer, then this is perfectly normal.  Or maybe it could be like that time I put on my rain jacket and umbrella and the rain actually increased for 10 minutes and then stopped, so if you believe that make sure you put on your raincoat before you open your umbrella.""  Like totally useless hindsight speculation trying to predict the future based on factors that have no impact on the outcome.

Why isn't he taking into account such a thing, which in itself is a MARKET TREND, and using that to not go so heavy on his doomsday prediction?

Because people just read the title and it's good enough for them.  Maybe that's the stupidity Hussman blames for the market doing the POLAR FUCKING OPPOSITE THING to what he promised it would do?  I dunno.  All I know is, a broken clock is right far more often than this guy has been.

Take it with a grain of salt.  The market IS investor attitude along with other fundamentals.  Confidence drives the price of things like crypto especially.  There's a LOT of people who stand to make some money betting the market will go down, and that's why the common theme from all these fudfuckers is simple:  attack confidence.",1643081767.0,2

Currency printing = currency debasement = inflation. Inflation primarily accrues to the benefit of asset holders at the detriment of those who don't. And what assets do they hold? Stocks, real estate, and Treasury bonds primarily.

So did the Fed create the bubble? In a sense, yes they did. But the ultimate culprit is the federal government.

So there's the base problem: in order to let the air out of the balloon, the Fed will have to raise interest rates. But who is paying most of that interest? The federal government and consumers.

These are a lot of assumptions that are trying to be passed off as facts based off of a relatively low sample size.

Nothing is guaranteed to recover, especially not any crypto. Likewise, nothing is guaranteed to bleed either. Investing in something, because of a ""well it hasn't died yet"" methodology is not a good strategy. Finding projects that you believe have a place in the future and are priced reasonably for what they offer is a good strategy.

but its okay. its a part of learning process we all have to go through to realize that holding aint gonna get u nowhere. technology changes, better one is being made, old ones dies. u need to evetually give up on some projects and invest in new ones. even if what u invested in u still trully believe in sometimes u just need to sell parts of it to get some profits....... like when musk stopped accepting btc for tesla it was point black obvious that BTC price will go down and some more green energy coins will go up. that was like most obvious prediction ever but i even held through that.

considering all inflation bullshit happening across entire world im not sure we will see new ATH on BTC / ETH any time soon. my sell goals will definitely be less then old ATH.  i bought btc this dip at 35k and if it reaches 55k thats already good enough sale point for me. but then what, when to buy back in? what if we never go lower then 45k and i keep waiting to buy 35k dip again and then i screw myself, or what if it simply continues to climb and goes to 100k and i sold it? that leaves me with option to sell only chunk of it not all etc. i was thinking about ""taking profit strategy"" a lot but never really figured it out. every idea i had i ended up realizing it could screw me over. i even made a few posts here asking how others take profit but i was never given any good advice mostly ppl just say dum HODL",1643080046.0,1

Spreading your eggs is a solid strategy for traditional finance; but for crypto it has far more risk than reward IMO. It’s simply because alts are so heavily valued on popularity and the latest trends that you have to closely watch not just your own holdings but ALL the upcoming developments, rumors, hype and chatter in the social cryptosphere or risk your holdings fading slowly into obscurity.

Traditional finance is based on real value and so diversifying is less risky because the value is backed by something already established. But crypto is purely speculative and for it to retain value it Has to have speculators, I.e. people who talk about it and hype it. How much attention do you think there is to go around? Thousands of new projects each year, every investor wanting to get in on the bottom, everyone wanting to be in on the latest greatest talk of the town. The older a project is the harder it has to fight for its relevance. 

 In 2021 I consolidated 12 projects into 2 (ETH and CRO) because I had infinitely more confidence in their longevity than any other project, even the ones with arguably better tech/utility. The majority of investors don’t dig that deeply into the technical accolades. they bet on popularity and relevance. Marketing is a key factor and almost every crypto project out there neglects it. That’s just asking to be marginalized. The key is finding projects with the right combination of 1)tech/utility and 2)public visibility. There aren’t many. Especially if you want 3)growth potential as well which decreases as popularity increases. I feel Lucky to have the opportunity to invest in ETH and CRO as they both have outstandingly high scores in each of those categories. I sold everything for those and now I sleep more, check the charts less, and my gains are much more reliable. But to each his own. Just my 2 sats.",1643066382.0,3

Now, sure, Cardano currently has some scaling issues; but did you know that performance/scaling is next-up on their roadmap? And you really can't fault them for something they haven't even had a chance to do yet...

[https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/)

...and this has been their roadmap for years now, BTW, and they've been slowly but surely working away at it all that time... and it currently looks like this:

Byron (Base UTxO Ledger): Done and Delivered  
Shelley (Proof-of-Stake): Done and Delivered  
Goguen (NFTs and Smart Contracts): Done and Delivered  
Basho (Scaling): Just starting...  
Voltaire (On-Chain Governance): TBD, but did you know that Cardano has a self-funding treasury to facilitate truly decentralized governance of the chain and its protocols?

And, yes, the very first dApps that were *just* launched weren't 100% exactly perfect on day one, but dApps on Cardano are still a very new thing, and it takes time to iron-out all the kinks...

A quick clarification that I think many of you will need to interpret this correctly… 

I came from a tradfi PM role and now run arbitrage bots on ethereum and other EVM chains and have noticed that the term ‘frontrunning’ in MEV / arbitrage is NOT the same as ‘frontrunning’ as most of you know it.

In tradfi, front running is seeing/ taking an order, buying the target with your own funds before the order goes through, and profiting from the price increase caused by the original order’s price impact. 

In crypto, that’s called a ‘sandwich’, usually because the sandwicher will immediately sell the position after the original trade, thereby sandwiching it.

One important thing to understand about most crypto blockchains is that transaction ordering is NOT based on the time the transaction was received.  Instead, each block collects transactions during a window of time . Let’s say 12 seconds (I’m oversimplifying here but I don’t want to lose focus).  During those 12 seconds, any transaction that is received will be in that block.  But they aren’t ordered by time received - instead they’re ordered by ‘gas price’… which is, in essence, a transaction fee.  The higher the transaction fee, the better the rank in the block’s transaction order.

For example let’s say I find an arbitrage opportunity with a profit of $100 and submit an order with a gasprice of $40.  Four seconds later, someone else submits an order for the same opportunity but uses a gasprice of $45.  As long as we both submit during the same 12s block window, *Their order will happen before mine* and they will get the profit and I will get nothing.  Not only will I get nothing, but I still have to pay the $40 gas price.

Although frontrunning is a part of sandwiching, in crypto it had a far more general meaning. It is the act of finding someone else’s profitable trade, simulating it, and submitting it as if it was your own trade but with a gas price of 1 higher than the original trade. 

The fascinating thing about this is that often times bots are the victims of being front run.  Some of the most notable examples of front running have occurred when exploiters have submitted a trade to exploit / hack an exchange for millions, only to have their exploit get copied and resubmitted with a higher gas price  by a generalized front running bot… who then usually gives the exploited funds back to the exchange once the front running operator realizes what happened. This happens more often than you would think.

It’s a fascinating world with completely different game theory than tradfi.  I just wanted to clear this up because I know that when I first started learning about it, I had a lot of trouble making sense due to the shared terminology having altered meanings.",1643055478.0,40

The $425+ per month pricing is for business accounts. It includes things like direct connectors to ERP systems. That pricing is outlined here: [oanda.com/foreign-exchange-data-services/en/exchange-rates-api/api-pricing/](https://oanda.com/foreign-exchange-data-services/en/exchange-rates-api/api-pricing/)

However, use of their API for retail accounts is free. It just doesn't include any features besides accessing the pricing data. If you want to do anything else, like integrate their pricing into another system (other than Metatrader) then you're on your own.

~~Documentation for that API is here:~~ [~~https://developer.oanda.com/~~](https://developer.oanda.com/) Edit: That link is giving a 404.

Edit 2: Here is a link to the documentation. They have REST, FIX, and MT4 APIs. [https://developer.oanda.com/rest-live-v20/development-guide/](https://developer.oanda.com/rest-live-v20/development-guide/)

I had not traded FX in several months, but I just fired up my cloud VM and queried the API to make sure that it was still free. It was. I pulled both demo and live prices without a problem.

Also, their API does include a real-time pricing stream. I do not use it. If they have started to charge for it then it's not a big deal because you can poll their API every few seconds to get the tick data. However, I doubt they have started to charge for it, because I'm sure they would rather you subscribe to the pricing stream than hammer their API with hundreds of requests per minute.",1643045444.0,2

You'll be surprised by how much your 14% weekly strategy will lose money.

5059,algotrading,Question about high frequency trading,420stonk69,1642920650.0,63,52,0.88,"There are a few things to consider. If you have a margin account (regardless of whether you’re trading *on margin*) you have access to sales proceeds immediately and can trade with unsettled funds. Settlement delays will only matter when it comes to cashing out. However, you’ll be subject to “pattern day trader” limitations if you have less than a $25k portfolio, meaning you’ll be limited to only a few day trades per week. If you have a $25k portfolio in a margin account, however, there is no restriction on day trades.

In a *cash* account on the other hand, you can make any number of day trades but you can’t trade with unsettled funds, no matter the portfolio size.  Doing so is called “free-riding”. If you are primarily day trading one security then pattern day trading and free-riding will probably be dealbreakers unless you put $25k in or don’t day trade until you hit $25k.

Once you do “unlock” daytrading, there’s still a limit of 390 orders per day on average, after which you’ll be reclassified as a professional trader and additional fees may be applied by your broker.

&#x200B;

I started as an Index Manager at a mid sized ETF shop 8 months ago. Since my background is in software engineering, I've developed an interesting pipeline for automating the construction and rebalancing of my indices. I use Bloomberg for all of my data, but I also use a proprietary screening model to select constituents. What I have pictured above is the Bloomberg Terminal running in an AWS Workspace in which I also have configured to run CRON-type scheduled jobs. I'm using the local Bloomberg API (for those that don't know, when the terminal is running it starts an api service on a local port) which I then expose to a script running in Github Actions. The script in actions connects to the service running in the AWS workspace, pulls the security universe, and then applies the scoring/screening model. When the selection process is complete, they are automatically send to the index engineer and implemented in the ETFs  


Getting back to my post, running the terminal in the AWS workspace has the fortunate side effect of me being able to access it on my MacBook after hours. It runs surprisingly well with low latency in the workspace, highly recommend.

My method is the only true way... being a Python developer myself, and using common sense, I poked around BQNT and found out it creates a sandboxed Juypter notebook on your machine.. so you just need to copy the dependencies...

1. You need blpapi installed...
2. copy these files from c:/blp/bqnt/environments/bqnt-2/Lib/site-packages/
3. bqapi
4. bqbreg
5. bql
6. bqlmetadata
7. bqrequest
8. bqutil
9. ciso8601
10. blpapi

Copy all those files from the Bloomberg directory to your python directory  Lib/site-packages... if you're using a venv, then put them in /env/lib/site-packages

Open vscode and import bql and start the service with bql.Service()

&#x200B;

if you are using a Mac like me, then do all this stuff on the windows side in Parallels, then run cmd  and type jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8889 to start the Jupiter server and open vs code on Mac and connect to the VM IP and port.

So far I was betting on Coinbase because it's registered with the German financial authorities, which I thought makes the tax stuff easier and shields me from scam coins (like that Squid Game situation).

But I understand that it's not the ideal platform for the type of scalping I'm trying to do. Of course I've discovered the CoinTracking/etc services in the meantime that run the tax-relevant numbers for me, so that reason is also irrelevant now. But the main point for going away from Coinbase should be the other comment about how it's not a leading market anyway.

It doesn't need to be high-end (using a 1050, for example, would still be much faster than a CPU), the data you're training on and the size of your model is the biggest factor, because it determines how much memory you need.

Edit: To clarify, it's possible to train on CPU, but if you're working on the model, you're going to go through a lot of training, (using different model graphs, data preprocessing, etc...), so it's very time consuming. You train a lot because each time you want to try any changes or improvement to the model, you go through more training. If you got lucky and built a perfect model on the first try, you would only need to train once, but you wouldn't know it was the best model unless you trained some other ones that weren't as good, to prove your first model was the best.

The difference between CPU / GPU is about an hour of CPU training for every 5 minutes on a GPU. I have used laptops without GPU to train in situations where I'm trying to build something really simple, or I don't care enough about the end accuracy that I need it to train for a long time.",1642693721.0,3
