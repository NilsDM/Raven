The idea of NFTs is interesting for gaming but the current approaches are very ignorant.

The advantage of non fungible items in gaming is that it would be impossible for people to cheat the system. For example, you might have heard about the fifa scandal in which developers were selling rare collectibles “under the table”. This was possible since in regular systems you can simply go into the database and add/remove lines which will affect the players. This makes it hard to differentiate real earned rewards from cheated ones.
 When using Blockchain technology, each item only exists once and has a history that goes back to its inception showing every owner and every transaction etc. This makes it practically impossible to cheat, since the item would also have a cheated “birth” that will show.",1643103421.0,35

The same gun is also visible to people when you walk into certain virtual rooms in Facebook's MetaVerse or when you walk around Decentraland. It's both visible on your avatar, and people could see a list of inventory items you carry. I might click on your profile and see you carry:

Nike Air 2025 Jordans (orange & black) - $90  
Reebok pump vintage re-issue (white) - $100 - FOR SALE  
Gucci Sunglasses - $400  
Commemorative Plaque (Charity Donation to Save the Children) - $200  
X20 Assault Rifle (Compatible TF, CS, Doom, FortNite) - $20 - FOR SALE  
StarWars Fan Badge (Earned 2023)

Perhaps you buy the physical items like Nike Air Jordans in real life and you get the NFT free, or perhaps some items only exist as NFTs.

When you walk about the street wearing your Rebooks, if you meet someone who is wearing Augmented Reality Glasses they can see when you bought them, and they can also see your avatar is your StarWars badge.

Now, to my mind this takes an unimaginable amount of cross-compatibility coding, but I guess that's what standardised protocols are for - making things work everywhere? 

And the idea is that these items are stored across the decentralised blockchain, so if Gucci's servers crash or go out of business your sunglasses don't disappear.

That's the vision, whether it becomes a reality I don't know. Technology moves incredibly quickly when it's profitable and the public are enthusiastic about it. Think of how quickly Music and Video streaming took over. But these are comparatively easy to implement.

The fact that these NFTs are player-owned and easily traded helps create some monetary value to the time a player puts into the game. 

It may be true that these can technically still be achieved without NFT or blockchain technology, but I think without it the player economy is still centralized within a platform / game whereas relying on a blockchain that houses multiple applications like these does open up the decentralization part a bit further beyond just a single game and its players. 

That said, I do believe these games need to engage players to come back for the non-earning portion and not just treat the game as a play-to-earn mechanism.

I think the best use case is game ownership. If you own the NFT, you own the game. You can sell it back when you're done or if you dont like it. This creates a free market where players have control on game prices.

Items and cosmetics could also be managed with NFTs. The pros would be a free market and the possibility for games to use existing infrastructure for item and cosmetics management and possibly reduce burden on their servers. Could also act as some sort of anti cheat where items cannot be duplicated or otherwise ""cheated in"". Also allows people to auction/ sell/trade their items while not actually playing. People at work could manage their items on their break if they want to. Cons would be ""why"" lol. Realistically, items and cosmetics are only usable in their respective games. Managing all of that has been done by the games since the beginning of times and it's not a problem that needs fixing.

11,CryptoTechnology,Can someone explain to me NFTs in gaming?,Puddingwastaken,1643102292.0,166,50,0.93,"The first thing you need to understand is that NFTs at their core do just one thing: proof of ownership. 

In the simplest form, NFTs in gaming basically just enable ""real money auction house"", or in this case ""crypto auction house"". The main difference is that your items persist even after the game dies and the server gets shut down, at which point they take on the role of a collectible.

More advanced implementations include allowing players to ""port over"" items from previous games (imagine being able to use your legendary Diablo 3 items in Diablo 4, etc), or getting some starting advantage with Diablo 4 for having certain Diablo 3 items, and so on. The ""metaverse end game"" that we're looking at is for items to be usable even in other games (as skins or actual items), and for all your in-game items to become accessories that you can use to personalize your metaverse avatar. While this *can* be achieved without blockchain tech, it's just easier because you don't need to build everything from scratch. The standards and the marketplaces already exist. 

An alternative use for NFTs in gaming is for each copy of a game to be an NFT. That will remove the need for all other forms of DRM, and also enable a resale market (think of the old days where you could sell your Nintendo cartridge to a friend after you're done). And also give you the ability to prove ownership of a game across different platforms (steam, gog, epic games, etc) without having to buy a copy on each platform. Why will game companies allow this? Because NFTs allow the original creators to receive a royalty with every sale. So they benefit from the resale market too.",1643122480.0,1

The promise of NFTs is this:

- Ownership of items you purchase in-game. That means you can re-sell them to other players and recoup your money. The original developer can also retain a small commission on re-sales which is incredible for indie devs. 
- Items built for decentralized web 3 game engines (Unity and Unreal are popular web 2 engines) can be used cross game. So buy an item from a creator for ExampleGE and use it in any game that uses ExampleGE. 
- Rare items or unique one of a kind items from creators, indie devs, or artists. These might have a special design or special in-game properties. An NFT is a digital contract, so creators can verify that yes this item is the one I created (certificate of authenticity) and owners can prove ownership. 

I love the promise of NFTs and realize both sides of any new technology. This vision is unlikely to be realized because publishers and corporate interests will (and already are) using NFTs as a new version of collectible in-game items with little inherent value.

Those NFTs are visible to anyone or any contract on the blockchain, and the point of NFTs is that they have consistent methods for accessing them. Say that a second game studio see's the first game and thinks: I like that game but wouldn't it be cool if you could do X. They can make their own game, which can access the NFTs from the first game (note this is just data, not the graphics of items etc.), and can essentially build a game where a player of the first game can use everything they've earned. Now initially the second game gives the player no advantage in the first (you can't generate NFTs for the first game in the second game), but if the first game studio thinks ""that's a great second game, we'd like to let our players use items earned there in our game"" then they can implement that.

By having the games on the blockchain, you can build an ecosystem of interoperable games. Maybe not all studios will want to reciprocate the use of NFTs, but some could. And as a player you end up in a position where moving to a new game doesn't mean starting from scratch.

one of his two major points was that you can't force in-game items from one game into another (eg, using battlefield guns in call of duty or fifa players in PES) which is largely true for the most part. he completely avoids what is probably the best use-case for nfts in gaming which is ownership and on/off-ramps. 

if there is a  very rare skin in call of duty that is awarded to me for winning a tournament, nfts would provide an aveanue to sell this item outside the game. if it's awarded to you as an nft, you can take that nft, sell it on a marketplace to someone else who is unwilling or unable to win it on their own. in the past you would need to sell your account and risk getting banned (depending on terms of service) to get real money for this digital asset. 

account selling for specific in game items or players is very common in games such as fifa (specifically in their ultimate team mode where you buy fifa points to open packs of players). some pro footballers will spend 10's or hundreds  of thousands on building the best team possible each year. right now EA keeps all of that as there is no ""offramp"" selling your player for ingame coins.

1. It is FUN. 

2. It is free to play and it is play to earn. It is NOT pay to play. There are many examples of free GU decks on the GU subreddit that have competed against the very best and most expensive decks. The benefit of this is you WIN rare and expensive cards.

3. Personally I have put in a few hundred dollars to buy chests to support the game. Recently a website that calculates card values of players have priced my collection at several thousand dollars. 

4. If I want I can sell these cards through the GU marketplace but also 3rd party marketplaces because I own the cards on the Ethereum blockchain. The game cannot set the values of the cards ensuring a free market economy for the cards.

5. The devs are responsive and constantly improving the game.

No one has ever given me a good reason why you wouldn't want to own the cards independently on the blockchain. This is the only way I see NFTs as valuable. Images of monkeys and Pixelated punks have no value but a card in relation to a game does have a lot of real world value and I have more ownership over the card than if I had it over a platform like steam. 

Yes, if the game disappears then the cards have no value, of course. But outside of that there really is no downside. It's been fun and easy money and does not feel like I'm being exploited. We all enjoy sinking countless hours into a game, it's just this one pays you to do it.",1643132248.0,3

An easier implementation would be to just have skins that can be transferred, with no effect on gameplay. Easier to imagine how to do this, but where’s the fun in it?

To really do this effectively, you’d need a standard cross-game-item protocol. For a shooter, such a protocol might have standards for type of gun, mag size, sights, upgrades, and so on. To make it look good in the game, there would be standards for location of the trigger, barrel, and sights - all relative to item holder’s hands, torso, and head. For the skins - well, you could have a preset standard selection of skins, or maybe you just allow some wacky looking skins in the game. As for game mode - maybe you have some standards there, after all it would be nice if such items were available in every game mode - but games wouldn’t need to support cross-game-items in every mode. 

This sounds super complicated (and it is!), but certainly not impossible, and I’m sure people will try it.

> This is exactly what I was talking about, though. You expect EA to implement blockchain technology into a future FIFA game to stop themselves from manipulating their game's economy? That's naive.

The point I think you’re missing is that consumer confidence in a project can create demand for it.  Consumers don’t have to wait until they’ve already bought a game to then decide to stop playing it. They might choose to buy a game and its items because they value the fact that the items are secured by a blockchain. 

> I agree that transparency should be expected. Applying blockchain technology to games, or more specifically expecting publishers/developers to do it in a way that is beneficial to the consumer, won't give you that. Sorry.

It’s not a zero sum game. If the game company cannot cheat and consumer demand therefore goes up, the in game items would have more value. In this way, the consumer and the game company can both win. 

Obviously - it wouldn’t work out this way for every game. But the point is that the incentives can be aligned to work in this way, making the games themselves more valuable to everyone.",1643136030.0,2

This is assuming they use a blockchain in a way that is transparent and in a way that you're not getting ripped off. I don't think this is going to happen given the track record of most, if not all major game publishers. Indies, sure, but why would an indie dev spend extra time implementing this when they could make their game better?

I think you're making a good point here, but again, this relies on the implementation being honest. I also just don't think it will work the way you think it will, nor will continue being supported if it even if someone decides to implement it in the way you hope they would; centralized blockchains exist, and I do not believe most games publishers will do any of this in a way that benefits the consumer in the way you all think it would.

The reason why I felt the need to make this distinction is simply because ""Blockchain"" can evolve to work without Proof of Work and, in fact, already has.

And if you actually just think about it it makes a lot of sense. If you don’t have actors with their own nodes, and they delegate their holdings to someone with a node, and then those nodes can be made on AWS, GCP, Azure (in fact the vast majority are on these three platforms), then not only is the network not decentralized, we purposefully made 3 of the richest companies in the world a hell of a lot richer while sacrificing insane amounts of decentralization. 

Perhaps the most relevant example in the market today is SOL going down every 2 seconds. Having millisecond settlement time while the speed of light still exists, should worry everyone. There’s no distributed networking in the world that is capable of this, until the infrastructure for EVERYBODY (including weakest links) is at something like 40Gb/s.

I'll copy and paste a reply I wrote over in /r/Hedera regarding Hedera's overall business model (and roadmap, I guess), just cos ain't nobody got time rewriting. Last couple paragraphs are the relevant bit but the rest is context.

""Many enterprises prefer a private dag network at the core of their infrastructure and for areas where they simply do not need public consensus.

These are designed to be modular and interoperable - this is more akin to tradition databases but built on the same kind of technology. 

IBM offer a whole suite of modular services for enterprise use in this area, with Walmart and Land Rover being some of the notable users. 

Hashgraph is designed to interoperate with these networks seamlessly providing public consensus or other specific functions if needed. 

The information is immutably encoded with no single point of failure, this remains very valuable - the private networks are more databases where Hashgraph helps create the internet out of them and allows parties that wish to do so interact directly with each other's databases with absolute trust.

In order to achieve this, Hedera offer the HCS - the simple and seamless capability of using the consensus service and nothing else. This isn't limited to private networks, anyone can use it if they so desire, as long as they pay their fees. 

This is useful for many Hyperledger clients, and you'll notice a significant overlap when comparing them with Hedera ecosystem partners (Walmart are heavily involved in promoting a new universal standard for digital coupons built entirely on Hedera's Hashgraph for example)

They also offer the HTS - programmable tokens at the native layer with all the performance on offer from the Hashgraph Algorithm (these offer about 80% of the functionality of Smart Contracts according to Mance - the rest can obviously be covered by the EVM and competing projects - if needed they can absolutely develop a superior smart contract platform but Hyperledger is already taking a good part towards this so mutual value is found.

The idea of modular, interoperable, open source infrastructure building up web 3.0 is the whole idea. You don't achieve that when one project wins alone, Hedera nonetheless offers value to the other parties within the ecosystem - that's what we're all about right? Cut out inefficiency and utilise the value gained. Just maths.

This brings me to the Hedera Smart Contract Service 

Hedera themselves aim to fully integrate Hyperledger Besu, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in the coming weeks - allowing Ethereum based dApps to run within Hedera and interact seamlessly with the Hedera ecosystem.  

Once complete, all the Ethereum developers have to do is copy and paste their code into the virtual machine and suddenly their dApp is running perfectly yet with the ~300 TPS of Besu.

Ethereum has been the focus on development because it's been the most stable platform - yet It will literally be far better to run Eth dApps on Hedera and incredibly easy with no real risk. Just an absolutely brilliant touch as far as I'm concerned and emblematic of the intelligence of their approach across the board.

Not a fan of Layer Twos personally, particularly because I haven't seen any marked advantages over a Hashgraph's native layer that doesn't come with a significant compromise. 

I understand you can make up for the compromise elsewhere but surely you understand why this becomes less and less tenable compared to a layer one solution which apparently achieves optimal performance from a mathematical standpoint in terms of security, throughput, and efficiency, without an apparent compromise.

Maybe quantum computing shakes things up, maybe something else does. Layer 2s are less speculative than that but speculative nonetheless

""Enterprise use demands stability in price - you need to write up a budget including operating costs so that you can see whether engaging in that activity is viable for your business. You simply cannot do that with variable gas fees, certainly not those of Ethereum-  and even Polygon's offering has been demonstrated to be a long way off with even a relatively small transaction volume. 

Why would an enterprise adopt and use a product that can suddenly increase 100x in cost without warning? Let alone one that can double.

Furthermore, HBAR fees may be fixed but the council can adjust them as they see fit. 

For example, minting an NFT costs $1. Avery Dennison plan to tokenize trillions of products, DLA Piper started out looking at tokenizing real-estate, now their plans go much further than even that. Obviously the adjustability of fees go both ways, I'm not hinging my argument on this particular revenue stream, the point is there's a lot you've missed, including other transaction types with their own associated fees.

Right now, for cryptocurrency transactions the price is fixed at (I think) 0.0001 USD. This is useful in its own right because it allows micropayment based usecases - a market which is completely inconceivable to you right now.

This is adequate at the moment as it incentives adoption and creates new possibilities. 

Right now the plan is to fund node operators through the treasury in the short term, if the current fees prove to be untenable past that stage, they will be changed. Adequately incentivising node operators to secure the network is an integral part of the design.

If, in the future, it is deemed that this particular type of transaction should cost more (or less) then this can be done. 

If the USD falls out of favour, they can find something else to peg it to.

If the miners turn out to be right and DLT is really just about paying a lot of money to miners and hodlers, then they can ramp the fees right up if they so desire.

My point is that this control Hedera have is a unique strength - you might disagree with how they've utilised it (I trust them and their partners a hell of a lot more than a random redditor), but nonetheless, the competing options are simply inferior and nothing else.

How does one take ETH or ERC tokens over to Hedera? I've never used it but given it is an alternative L1 I'm guessing some kind of trusted bridge. 

>Not a fan of Layer Twos personally, particularly because I haven't seen any marked advantages over a Hashgraph's native layer that doesn't come with a significant compromise... I understand you can make up for the compromise elsewhere but surely you understand why this becomes less and less tenable compared to a layer one solution which apparently achieves optimal performance from a mathematical standpoint in terms of security, throughput, and efficiency, without an apparent compromise.

Compromise is decentralization. 'One day the companies on our network will run more of the nodes' isn't even a promise to become decentralised, it's distributing cost/responsibility of operation but not to a meaningful degree as it's hand selected node operators.

That's OK because it doesn't look like HBAR is really trying to compete with L2s. It's competing with enterprise blockchain. The TPS, etc etc etc, should all be way better- there are only 20 nodes. Ethereum ~10k is a fair baseline. Again HBAR isn't trying to compete on decentralization, that's fine, but it does mean as platform there is a compromise. Its not speed, UX or 'security' from external forces you sacrifice, it's the ability to (hypothetically) spin up a node and 'fact check' what the team says/does etc. 

Also the EVM compatible 'just ctrl+c ctrl+v' meme seems to imply 'it just works' but how can it reconcile different EVM implementations? Sure I buy ethereumJS to HBAR is copy+paste but what if the code isn't JS to begin with? I'm not technical enough to know so I'm asking authentically.

Well that's the thing, with Hedera's governance currently decentralized between a council of 25 legally accountable, term limited, real world institutions - each running a secure and high quality node with independent infrastructure - Hedera offers new qualities of transparency and regulation, and does not hinge on the dubious security of anonymous governance or overreaching developer control. 

In this current state I would go as far to say that it's more decentralized than any networks disproportionately using only a few centralized servers in a few geographically centralized location. The amount of nodes is also less relevant than the amount of nodes operators. 

What you missed is that this design is a deliberate approach to create the conditions needed for a permissionless, fully distributed network down the line - and yes, create a product secure enough for enterprise use (which fully aligns with the demands of secure public use in this case) 

Going permissionless straight off the bat without creating safeguards against exploitation means that while your network can be decentralized in theory, it is far less likely to be in reality. The truth is that the extremely wealthy disproportionately control these systems right now and there is no way to reliably reverse that. 

And there will be millions of nodes, run by us, on our phones. Hedera possessing genuine scalability means they are able to achieve incredible performance and security. When I say there's no compromise I really mean there just isn't one. It's pure mathematical efficiency at every level. 

They are competing with the Layer 2 of other networks by achieving what they do at the native layer - Hedera's own Layer 2s will be built as appropriate and will represent absolute technological advance - not petty competition. For example, ZK snarks are one of the more well designed Hedera Improvement Proposal made thus far and I would expect it to be on the way - reconciling private trust with public transparency.

Effective and transparent governance - not something Eth possesses I'm sorry to say - is an essential part of the equation - even a fourth prong to the 'Trilemma' if you ask me.

When your system is dependant on goodwill it is absolutely and irreconciably vulnerable to exploitation, take communism - another ideology which people love in theory but fell tragically short in practice because too much trust was given in those who controlled the means based on their 'commitment' to the 'greater good'.

Hedera offer universal zero trust architecture for the world - much larger in scope, requirements, and stakes than anything we've seen.

I'm honestly lacking in terms of the technical knowledge so I'm afraid I can't help to much with your developer based questions - don't really know what the process looks like 

I will say Hedera and the HBAR foundation offer a lot of technical support - both published and on-demand. The blog at Hedera.com might be a good place to start.

So my understanding is that the EVM used in Smart Contracts 1.0 currently supports most Ethereum based code running with the efficiency, low latency, and predictable fees of Hedera (note the predictable fees are rooted in the fact that you couldn't congest it if you tried, and would make me a lot of money trying). 

The tokens remain outside of the Hedera network however and smart contracts only run with a TPS equal to that of Ethereum- itself 

The Hyperledger Besu integration behind Smart Contracts 2.0 however is much more capable, fully compatible with solidity, with throughput in the hundreds of TPS. 

Vitally, these smart contracts are now fully interoperable with Hedera's native layer - tokens can be wrapped and moved around with the full attributes of Hedera's native layer including security, finality, speed. 

Their own smart contracts will be able to operate with Besu's performance - a drastic improvement on Ethereum at present which can be continually developed to at least match any advances Eth rolls out.

 They're even buying offsets against the (minimal) electrical cost so you'll be able to say your network is carbon negative.

>The set of shards can be arbitrarily sized, enabling massive parallelization of the consensus process. Notably, this form of parallelization introduces a tunable tradeoff between security and scalability: reducing the number of shards each node covers increases parallelism and scale, but decreases the validator set size of a given shard. This capability allows the system designer to select a minimum threshold of per-shard node coverage that achieves high practical security, while maximizing parallelism and scale by allowing a large number of independent nodes. This is unique to Cerberus and discussed further in the analysis section.

So they can *kinda* place the tradeoff however they want with the way their sharding design works.  But the way they frame it here is the misleading part, and where it reveals that Radix doesn't really solve any new problems because they don't do anything to decrease the overall load of fully verifying the ledger, so sacrificing decentralization as the network utilization increases and compromising its resistance to validator corruption by forcing reliance on third parties.",1642614801.0,1

These are incorrect - processing is also extremely parallel and only happens on the shards related to a transaction.

The Cerberus Infographic series is a great resource that digs into the mechanisms behind Cerberus cross shard consensus and the role the Radix Engine plays to abstract away dealing w/ sharded data from dApps and the developer.

The following are excerpts from Chapters 12 and 13. (It may be easier to open up the pdf versions to find text easily).

>***Chapter 12 selections - on parallel transactions across shards***  
>  
>Moreover, one of the key concepts that allows this to happen is that of parallel processing. In a future where Radix has scaled to fulfill the DeFi needs of billions of people, the vast majority of transactions will involve completely unrelated substates, shards, and validator sets. Those transactions will be processed entirely in parallel across the vastness of the shardspace without ever being “aware” that the other transactions exist.  
>  
>But not everything can be processed in parallel. There must still be some logic that tells Cerberus when substates are related and must be composed in the same transaction.  
>  
>***Chapter 13 selections - on partial ordering***  
>  
>Therefore ideally, you have a network that’s intelligent enough to only order when it’s absolutely necessary, so that it can process as many transactions as possible in parallel. We therefore want a network that has “partial ordering”  
>  
>....  
>  
>For Radix, that layer of logic is the Radix Engine. It tells Cerberus which substates are related and must be ordered, and which ones are not related and do not need to be ordered and can thus be safely parallelized.  
>  
>So how does the Radix Engine do this?  
>  
>When a transaction is created, it must follow rules stipulated by the Radix Engine. Those rules stipulate that only required substates are used in a transaction, and that when new substates are created, that those are broken down into as many substates as possible, that still make logical sense  
>  
>....  
>  
>Because of the Radix Engine, nodes therefore only need to undertake consensus on the absolutely most minimal set of shards required.  
>  
>If events are not related, they just get processed in parallel, across the entire shardspace, which is so large in size as to be practically infinite.",1642658915.0,4

is people spending large quantities of money* for tokens which represent an image and do little else, a trend which will die out shortly? Hopefully.   

I don't see what problem you think NFTs for music is supposed to solve? You talk about removing middlemen, but NFTs don't seem to provide anything for that that just, letting people buy the song online using a cryptocurrency, doesn't already provide.  

If you think that they could help with DRM for audio in a way that isn't feasible for DRM for images on account of images being screenshot-able, you should know that the same can be done with audio (might be slightly more difficult, but cannot be really protected against.).  

(Also, DRM on music is against freedom)  

I of course agree that being able to more easily create/handle tokens that represent individual intangible things can be useful.

edit: also, if scalability issues are solved (or possibly using a permissioned chain with a large number of known entities, who could be held accountable for any behavior contrary to what the protocol dictates?) then the idea (which some are already pursuing) of using tokens to track what resources went into making products, in order to be assured about where the materials came from, and where the labor and other steps were done, when a manufacturing process involves materials being bought and sold between many companies. Like e.g. where did the oil come from to make this plastic? where was the plastic made? where was the plastic made into parts of shoes? The shoe company presumably doesn't process the oil into plastic themselves, nor the other materials.
Of course, these assurances would only be as trustworthy as those who made them, at least this would make it so they can be tracked. Like, if you are making a cake to sell, you can't generate yourself the assurance that the eggs were from a farm with humanely raised chickens without inventing a made-up farm entity to sign those, which people wouldn't recognize as an existing farm. An actual farm might claim to raise their chickens humanely but not actually do so, and this wouldn't solve that problem, but there are other solutions for that part. This still helps avoid the issue of the cake-maker making up the info about the source of the eggs though. (Because, the problem of checking if a farm exists is even more solved than checking if the farm raises their chickens humanely.)  

(to be clear, I'm not like, especially interested myself in animal welfare stuff, just describing it as a use.
Another use could be getting certifications that various steps in the process didn't emit large amounts of CO2, or something. Would need certification organizations for that, but still.)",1642553882.0,5

What people misunderstand is,

To mint an NFT opensea charges 2.5% of final price , same with rarity and in case of nifty is 5% and 50cents on every secondary sale, This may sound a lot but the thing is that all this gas fee should be there to incentivize the miners, without which all this would never happen.

 Also more users might/might not decrease the gas fee as this would lead to congestion and hence higher the gas fee faster will your nft be minted.

260,CryptoTechnology,Are NFTs really meant to be a quick and ephemeral trend?,Accomplished_Mess116,1642531885.0,178,59,0.87,"I think as of now we’re in the alpha stage of NFTs, just to see what they can do, if they’re viable, or if they need to be pivoted to other use cases.

The main way that I have thought about NFTs being useful would be in a subscription/membership based model. Like for example if an exclusive restaurant issued X amount of NFTs that indicated that you held a reoccurring reservation, or just that you were allowed to eat at that particular restaurant. This NFT now not only holds value for the owner of it, but also for the restaurant.

The restaurant would gain an initial investment, and the customer now has an asset that will hopefully appreciate if the restaurant does well. Now if it does appreciate, then the customer could sell the NFT for a profit, the restaurant could then make X percentage on the resale, and would now have record of who the person sold to. This would obviously be a permission based blockchain.

I think that NFTs in particular could be useful for something like this because if it’s a smaller, permission blockchain then it would be easier to track sale and re-sale history. It would also just streamline some processes (re-sale, commission collection, knowing who holds what NFT) that could otherwise be a nuisance, or simply not cost efficient. They could also have an NFT verification system at the restaurant to prevent any forgery. There are definitely other ways to do this outside of just NFTs but this has been the primary way that I see NFTs actually having utility.

If anyone disagrees then please let me know because I would love to hear what other people think but this is just the idea that I’ve played around with.",1642602184.0,1

Ethereum is like a general purpose decentralised computer where you have a lot of freedom with what you can build on top of it and pay for computation time whether it succeeds or not. Tokens and non-fungible tokens are simply a code standard.

Algorand utilize the account model like Ether. The account model works by removing tokens from one account and adding it to another account in a transaction causing the state of all involved accounts to be a part of the transaction. Instead of being general purpose, it is developed for financial assets and has native support for it. This simplifies some things like asset transfers, has some benefits like fixed cost, and comes with a lot of features and configurability for assets making it suitable for regulated assets.

Cardano use an UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output) model, similar to Bitcoin, instead of an account model. To send a transaction you spend tokens as inputs and create new UTxOs. One address can have several UTxOs so instead of a global state of accounts you have to validate for a transaction, you simply spend a token as an input and create a UTxO belonging to a different address. Cardano doesn't offer feature rich assets like Algorand or decentralised computing like Ethereum but you can accomplish some of the same things by making a Script/UTxO that holds an NFT or Token instead of an account holding it directly.

As an analogy: there are some operations that your computer can do right in its hardware, and so it is not necessary to write a program to execute them. For instance, arithmetic like integer addition is an operation that modern cpus have a module for (the ALU). It is, however, still possible to do addition without making use of this hardware (although this would be a nutty idea).

*"" Are there any safeguards to ensure that L2 doesn't act maliciously?""*

There are two levels of safeguards. The first is in L2 itself, depending on the L2 technology itself and how it's configured, there are generally rules about what you can and can't do and you will be punished if you do not follow them. This ""punishment"" step is often handled by the L1, and this is the second layer of safeguard. For example, if you are transferring coins through some lightning nodes and one lightning node doesn't transfer the coins as promise, a lightning node can take that info to the L1 chain and say ""hey, look, they promised they'd transfer the coins and they didn't!"" and L1 chain will force the transfer or revert the transfer or whatever the rules require. In short, L2 provides transaction capacity while relying on L1 only for enforcing rules when something goes wrong.

For optimistic rollups, the safeguard is that participants who verify the transactions and submit fraud proofs in case of any fraudulent activity.

For ZK rollups, the layer 1 smart contract verifies that the zero knowledge proofs submitted by the layer 2 operators are valid.

\>  What if an L2 operator pushes an update that sends 10% of every transaction to their own wallet

Transactions have to be signed by the sender, otherwise they are invalid. For zk rollups, this means that an operator trying to insert fraudulent transactions will submit an invalid zero knowledge proof that will be rejected by the layer 1 smart contract. For optimistic rollups, this means that a participant who detects the fraud can submit a fraud proof and be rewarded for it while the malicious operator is penalized.

Opening up new revenue streams via resale commission. But the offering for buyers/collectors hasn’t been particularly great. I personally am not interested in the whole “buy to get access to our private discord” - and it looks like being part of an exclusive online club doesn’t seem to be enough now. The issues with theft and rip offs are a real bummer but this happens today in the art world. It’s just that with the blockchain everyone can see how much was stolen and what was used to rip people off. 

The more interesting applications do intrigue me though, as NFTs are proof of ownership having utility in the real world could add real value. Redeemable events, conferences and concerts, access to restaurants and physical goods all exist in the NFT world today. I’m curious how this will pan out. 

In video games the idea of NFTs gets met with a huge amount of hate - not just dismissal. Sure companies need to buy in and invest time to use the blockchain data in their products. But let’s not use the argument of “buy x here use it there”.  Today if you purchase a digital good today it’s account bound. You can sell your account but that’s against TOS in most cases and it’s an all or nothing affair. The company owns your account and can revoke access at any time. Some companies allow you to resell digital goods, but only through their storefront and limited to other users who don’t already have the item. Blockchain would allow you to send, sell or burn on any store that uses that blockchain (or send off chain). If your account gets banned or stolen, your purchases are in your wallet and you can take them with you. Again, it’s the ownership that’s important not the uniqueness in this scenario. 

Then there’s interesting applications in the digital publisher world. If you purchased game licenses as NFTs and could use them at any digital store, and buy or resell through them. The store takes a cut to make some money, the publishers get commission and you actually own the game license. But that’s all pipe dream stuff and not likely. An interesting thought experiment. 

Something to remember when people call NFTs worthless is that they are literally tokens similar to any other crypto based token. The main different with ERC-20 and ERC-721 is that ERC-721 has a unique id and metadata. It’s just that 1 ETH = 1 ETH but 1NFT ≠ 1 NFT. If you agree that ERC-20 tokens have value, given that NFTs are a type of token, then they must have value in both scenarios. It’s just that the demand is a lot lower on one side of the fence, right? And rightly so - most owners want to flip and make money and nothing else. 

It’s worth noting that the metadata can be changed (that’s how NFTs reveal) and that they normally link to IPFS, a web api or URL to pull back the digital item. So the image, sound clip, video, digital selling point of an NFT can go offline in some cases. Then what value does it hold? It’s quite a compelling argument against them if the thing you bought for can disappear, but to each their own.",1642347523.0,2

This is not true if NFT dApp uses IPFS for artworks storage, as IPFS is an example of a content-addressable storage technology (the address of a file is only its hash).

The hash of the file on IPFS works differently than checksum. For example, it is not enough to make a very small change to the image, such as changing a single pixel.

The intention of IPFS designers was to protect data against deliberate (editing of a photo, changing a word in the text) altering the data, and not changing it as a result of accident.

First: speculative assets just about always experience price volatility, often because of expected future adoption. This is the way humans behave, and it is rational in this specific way, even though it seems irrational at arms-length. Because this is the way people behave, it should be expected. 

Second: some real artists have made real NFT art. Kevin Abosch is a widely well-regarded artist (one among many), and he has programmed the creation of NFTs as art. Art collectors would say that has value in the art marketplace. 

Third: if you’ve been in crypto for a while, you must know it works exactly this way. ICOs start making money, then you start seeing billions of new ICOs, most of which are absolutely ridiculous. New joke tokens start seeing their tokens boom, then we start seeing more and more joke tokens. 

Fourth: crypto is irrational as part of its ethos. Have you actually talked to people in the crypto space? They make zero sense most of the time, and that is perfect in its own way. Why? Because crypto has always been about doing something so different and so disruptive—so non-sensical—that regular people would finally have a chance at participating in global markets. We don’t trust intellect or reason or people in this context; instead, we trust the technology. The nature of blockchain is that we do not trust any particular individual; instead, we trust the community which sustains the interest in (and maintenance of) the blockchain. 

It is, in a way, a rebellion. All of these sensible, intelligent economic systems have left people feeling as if they are poor and without viable options. If NFTs also leave people poor and without options, well, at least it was done by choice. (“You think I’m stupid and what I’m doing is stupid? Well, I made more trading monkey pics in my underwear than you made at your soul-sucking corporate job—so who’s stupid now?” —this is the feeling that drives a lot of NFT enthusiasm, in my opinion.)",1642319148.0,-5

1) (optional) have the contract which tracks who owns how many of each type of card, allow a feature where you can freeze your ability to transfer the cards for a fixed amount of time  
2) at the start of the match, player’s decks are registered (possibly using some stuff to commit to them without revealing the content of one’s deck to the other player, but still granting them an assurance that one has the tokens for all the cards in one’s deck)  
3) pass back and forth signed messages describing moves and gamestate (and timestamps), in ways that are verifiably valid given the previous state. In order to handle the hidden information of “what cards are in your hand”, use the same techniques which have been used for preventing cheating in [online poker without a central server] .  
4) If any player makes an invalid move, the other player can prove this fact and win (presenting the proof to the smart contract), tell them to make a valid move, or, if they choose, allow the invalid move (if more than 2 players, or if someone other than these two players has an interest in the game, then all players, or a representative for all interested parties, must sign the same message agreeing to accept the invalid move as valid. Alternatively, committing to this not being a possibility can probably be done by using some kind of proof aggregation thing in order to be able to succinctly prove to the contract at the end that all the moves made were valid.)  
5) If a player doesn’t make a move within  a given time limit, then the next player can submit a dispute claim to the smart contract, either where this would count as the other player forfeiting, or skipping their turn, and where the player skipped has a given amount of time during which they can contest this.  
If the player making the claim had previously signed a move which came after the move they claimed wasn’t being made, they are cheating and they lose.  

There is a substantial issue here, where by refusing to make a move, (or, by refusing to send one’s opponent the message describing one’s move), one could force the other player to make their moves on-chain, as you say, which would be problematic.

(Of course, wouldn’t need the entire game state or move description, just a commitment, but still)  

6) finally, final move is verified as valid by the contract (or, if this would be computationally expensive, committed on the smart contract with a claimed result, and only verified by the contract if the claimed result is contested.)

__________

However, a much simpler solution, would be to not even have a smart contract have any transactions during a match at all, where except when cards are being traded/sold/issued/banned/unbanned , the clients simply, check the state of the smart contract, without any transaction happening.  

(Why do you want to be able to cryptographically validate all the moves of a game with a changing card list? That is very complicated with not much benefit.)  

If you want to have betting on the results of the match, just use a 3rd party judge (or panel of judges, depending on the importance of the match).

I don’t think there’s much tendency for judges to cheat or be bribed in big card game tournaments.

And, if there is a standard simulator which encodes the rules of the game, it becomes fairly unambiguous whether a ruling is legitimate. A rules judge who was bribed would lose all reputation as a rules judge.",1642372165.0,1

The current BTC hashrate is ~200 EH/s, so a 51% attack would need ~100 EH/s (100x10^18 H/s).

The Antminer S19 does about 100 TH/s (100x10^12 H/s), so you'd need around a million of them.

In practice that's way more than actually exist, but it's just a thought experiment.

It's a 3kW unit, so each one consumes 24x3 = 72kWh per day.

The cheapest electricity in the US is around 7c per kWh, so at that rate, you'd spend 72x0.07x10^6 = $5.02M / day to maintain a 51% attack.

Of course, that ignores the hardware costs. The retail cost per unit is $11,500, so the hardware alone would be north of $11.5B.

Edit: I just realized that technically it wouldn't be enough to have half the *existing* hashrate, you'd need to *match* the existing hashrate for a 51% attack, so you can double all those figures, and it would be more like $23B upfront + $10M/day.",1642350989.0,16

They are not art, they are an asset. If you invest in an NFT collection you get more than just an image displayed in your wallet. You gain access to the community and depending on the project, passive income, brand awareness, irl events, 3d models, early access to upcoming projects etc.

And possibly emotions of community and identity. Many people still can’t grasp it because they didn’t experience it yet.

I think NFTs are the evolution and combination of meme coins and DeFi. Less abstract, more approachable and more appealing than traditional crypto. I got a free LOOKS drop based on my NFT trading, that is currently staked at 800% APR. The crazy part, this could be (more or less) sustainable because their NFT platform gives 100% of the trading fees to stakers. The high volume is currently mainly based on wash trades but they will take over plenty of volume from Opensea in the long run. Looksrare is a billion dollar venture in the hands of the NFT community. It's just easier and safer for investors compared to providing liquidity on i.e. Uniswap.

The numbers show this as well. We just crossed 1million users on Opensea, which is nothing yet. But take a look how steep that graph is.

Why would a company bother with that? If a game is networked, it still probably needs servers running to control things, since you can't just trust clients. A more decentralized setup that allows self-hosted or private server managed games with smaller groups is feasible, but then you've still got hosts with control. A p2p setup is possible, but then we're getting into a really limited set of games and a lot more complexity for the net code of a game. If you have your own servers to power the networked aspects of a game, then why not have them vend such data as well?

The reality is that reading data from the blockchain directly is pretty difficult today without running a node on the network.

A potentially better way to achieve similar results to what you described would be for a company to have a fully public dataset available at all times. A simple readonly API for it works just fine. If the company servers ever shut off, the community can fork the last state from it and let that be the source of truth. Different clients can all individually fork off on their own as well.

False. Understanding what makes proof of work the single known way to distribute control without central permission takes people a while. Proof of stake has been around and recognized to be an irrelevant fallacy for most of decade, at least in technically literate circles.

Sustainability of completely permissioned centralized systems doesn't really matter if a permissioned centralized system isn't your goal, and if it is we already had much more efficient systems for achieving that for decades.

Also very few seem to grasp the incentives at play in Proof of Work systems which goes far beyond just hash power.

It's incredibly obvious that proof of stake requires permission of previous stake owner to gain any access to control since tokens have owners and stake owners are literally rewarded for withholding control forever. Needing central permission to control is central control. Not only can proof of stake not be ever classified as decentralized, it's literally incentivizing continuous centralization of control.

Proof of work relies on permissionless external resources (matter/energy) for this reason with unforgeably continuous costs for all making it necessary to give up control to break even. It managed to do something completely unprecedented and unique - to prove something was done in outside world on-chain. There is nothing like it.

This is not the case, proof-of-stake coins are inflationary meaning they print coins each block, in many coins, being a large staker means your coins only keep pace with increasing supply (assuming total value of the coin's market stays the same). Staking rewards are generally linear and proportional to the amount of coin you have, so you don't automatically have all wealth converging into a couple of large addresses.

In other words, if you have 10% of the coin supply now and you continue to stake with it, you will still have 10% in five years. Your 10% is now 50 coins instead of 10, but it's the same percent of the market share.",1642300020.0,3

At least proof of stake protocols like Navcoin's give each node the same percentage of rewards each year, +- 7% nowadays in which it doesn't matter if you stake 1 or 100000 coins.

This is done by implementing coin age, meaning that if you have 1 coin staking for a long time it will eventually stake purely because of the time spend staking.

to me, the metaverse is much more subtle.  it's a universal wallet + identity package that you use as your internet facade that you can plug into apps to verify ownership and identity.  it allows for cross-functional collaboration between apps and users while maintaining all control over one's data and property.  

whether that evolves to VR?  current tech is not ready for everyday use so hard to predict.  but I believe a world where there are more computers in everyday objects that can hook up to your digital wallet/identity is more likely imo.",1642108345.0,10

I see it as AR more than VR. 

Imagine adding ambiance/decorations to a restaurant through AR glasses. 

Imagine Pokemon Go but even more immersive. You can have subsets of people walking around interacting with the Pokemon Go universe, where they see Pokemon around them to catch, while another subset of people are tuned into the Avengers, Harry Potter, or LotR metaverse, with whatever that entails. It’d be like LARPing but to the extreme.

Imagine coming home and your entire house is decorated with NFTs: if you want to rearrange things for decor, instead of having to physically move things, you can just move them virtually. You could have a pet dragon, fountains of lava, unicorns, mermaids, and whatever else you want in your home.

In all these interactions, the physical world would still be present, but you are augmenting what’s already there with things that are only possibly virtually. You can even tie NFTs to physical objects. So, for example, you could have a wand that’s just some stick object in the real world, but because you own the NFT for that wand, you can use that stick in the real world to cast spells in the metaverse.

I don’t know if this vision will ever come to pass, but that’s how I can see the metaverse having the most tangible success, rather than some VR game everyone’s playing.",1642103603.0,30

Yes !!

I'm a long time gamer, started with Pokemon Yellow and up to today's games. I've always been a fan not only of playing but of the whole video game culture and the progression of game play along the years.

I was able to try out a VR game about a year ago, and while I thought it would be boring and not so revolutionary, I was hooked up as soon as I entered the tutorial.

So far I didn't dive deep into it because it's not really my cup of tea, but I was really amazed by the possibilities with a technology and games that are still young in my opinion. The immersion was great and to me it's one of the most important part for many games that are supposed to put you in a character shoes or that let you dive in a specific universe.

 So I want to try it out and I want to follow how things will evolve around that, and I think that great things will be possible, despite the fact that it'll probably won't be used the way it's supposed to be (like how social networks are bringing up so many opportunities but are used in a way that's useless and annoying for most).

And don't get me wrong, I will still want and love to go outside camping or whatever, but if the metaverse is gonna be here and if it end up being popular, I want to check how it is at the very least.",1642106288.0,10

VR/AR is as stated fairly new but the actual concept of a metaverse is not. GTA, Assassin's Creed, C.O.D and many gen games all need a metaverse where players can interact. where crypto and finances go is more towards RP/MMO style games. there was this one game that was very popular called imvu. it actually had its own metaverse and interactions to buy real clothes or furniture brands but to style your in game avi and rooms. 

i believe that as we go forward with communication and social experiences more apps and sites withove towards the RP style interfaces. i can definitely see Instagram doing this. there are many light weight apps and games that can implement a full metaverse/market system that works for the masses. 

you could go on and on with different use cases and reasons/ideas for metaverses but it all boils down to the original meaning and social interaction. there is this ome show called ""westworld"" thats based on a metaverse type. it's probably actually somewhere in the works as we speak. but that would be large scale.

593,CryptoTechnology,Do you genuinely want to use the metaverse?,wballard8,1642102601.0,346,124,0.93,"Personal opinion:

# Social interaction

Online gaming is fun for the social interactions, not the P2E hype nor game genres. Social media & media conferencing is good (if anonymousity mantained) & bad (if IRL identity locked on). Why? Me personally more readily open up myself in anonymous & make friends in like, than being around bunches of elderly that always raise issue of respect & so called ""more wise & experiences"" in life (Hence the death of FB). We trancended the era of respect based on age, race, geographical boundaries, social rank; into respect based on open wisdom & ideologies.

# Administration

Regulations is important in any interaction platforms. However, I trust consistent regulation by artificial intelligence more than by human gut feeling. Guess this blockchain not entirely trustless. AI is emotionless (sin-less), almost to the level of gods. Yes, technology improve interconnectivity like shopping & services, but the administration rules (by single authority) the one that most people complain. Also, platform administration exposure to the users also allows more tolerance & understanding why certain platform actions are taken, instead of shear blame of greed or irresponsibility.

# Others factors

I don't understand the need for VR (some people have 3D sickness) & NFT (abstract artistic value that only the crazy rich can apprehend & accept) too. In game items trading might increase game interactivity, but I understand no further than that. For example, minecraft players can play anonymously (though certain regulation by AI is needed) for social & trading for some in game item might solve scam issue, but everything else is clueless to me.",1642309223.0,1

I would be glad if it is **limited only for gaming**. I am not ready for the social consequences that are brought upon the proliferation of metaverse-like social activities being the norm nor I would think that is the ""best"" for society overall.

I understand the appeal of tearing down the borders of length and self-representation in Metaverse. I think that is ""good"" for just occasional VR RP for fun. However, just with cryptocurrency and NFTs (allegedly), its function can be perverted into something much more sinister...

Pegging it as lifestyle? Apparently exchanging and advertising it to be ""better"" than the real, breathing universe? No... Just no... It's their world that they allow you to experience. I dread that kind of lifestyle and that kind of control by one corp. For discussion's sake, I will ignore the statement about how the real world is also controlled with (differing levels of) authority from the government.

As for metaverse, I think I have been around for long enough to witness the rise of Second Life. I basically think that it is cool... until you touch grass and meet other people. Sure, there are a few despicable individuals out there, but I am fortunate enough to live in a nation that I don't need to be (90% of the time) afraid to be stabbed and robbed out of nowhere.

646,CryptoTechnology,Do you genuinely want to use the metaverse?,wballard8,1642102601.0,346,124,0.93,"Never said it should. It should cost as much as people are willing to pay and sell them for. The costs of NFTs currently are outrageous and unrealistic. Current costs are not what a healthy metaverse would look like. Maybe for collector’s items. But who knows. They’ll cost whatever people are willing to buy and sell em for.

For example, if you have an NFT for a wand in the Harry Potter metaverse that allows you to perform certain very powerful spells, and there are only a few copies of that wand in existence, then it makes sense that it would cost a lot. Now, if that same wand existed in another metaverse and did the exact same things but was abundant, people could switch to that metaverse instead and capitalism would take over from there to determine the optimal price. It all depends on how well developed the metaverse is and how much people are willing to spend for a product in one metaverse environment as opposed to another. 

I’d be willing to bet people would spend a lot more for a powerful wand in the official Harry Potter metaverse than for that same wand in a random no-name metaverse. But if that random no-name metaverse has good developers that create a fun, desirable environment, then that wand could then increase in price.

I’m assuming here that there will be multiple metaverses because I find it hard to believe that there will be one metaverse with a monopoly on the entire space, though that’s entirely possible (could see an Apple vs Android metaverse type of thing happening). If there were to be one main metaverse though, you can bet your ass that any items that are scarce will be expensive as hell. 

I imagine there might be one main metaverse platform that will prevail over others, as it has the best design / SDK, and the majority of developers will choose to develop using their platform, similar to Apple with iPhones. Then other competitor metaverse platforms will try to compete and will be around but won’t be as prevalent as the main one for whatever reason (like Android / Windows phones).",1642115034.0,2

Social media can we quite toxic and highly addictive but it’s at least easy to detach from and use in a constructive way. It’s not a fully immersive experience. My thing with the metaverse is that it’s entirely immersive, and why would people want to detach from that when 1. it feels so real and 2. it’s so comfortable.

Slightly harder to not realize that one isn’t following when reading than when watching.  

The important thing is doing. 

Get an interpreter or compiler installed and working, and get a very simple program to run (this may be copied and pasted, though it may be better to type it in yourself), and then come up with the simplest change you can think of to what you want it to do, that you think you can make, and make that change.
(I imagine you’ve progressed past “Hello, World.”, but if you were at that stage, a decent first thing to try would be “Hello, Wokeman1.”)

 If it doesn’t work, great! You need to be used to that experience. Figure out why.  
If you get an error message you don’t understand, look it up. 
(Though, before you look it up, read it. I mean, if it is many lines long, you don’t need to read the whole thing, but like, you wouldn’t paste the whole thing into google either.). 

Fix the error.
Get it working.  
Make other changes, of increasing difficulty, which require gradually more understanding.

(Fix the errors you encounter each time.
“There are two alternating steps in programming, adding bugs, and removing them.”)

Ask yourself what you can do with the things you’ve understood so far.  
What would be something neat you could do? What can you do with what you’ve learned so far that is potentially surprising that you can do it with that?
What’s something you aren’t quite sure how to accomplish, but you feel like you’re close to being able to?  
What’s the part that’s missing? Break it down.  
Look it up.  

You don’t need to learn all the language features right away, but you should be on the lookout for language features that you aren’t experienced with yet, and which would make things easier/cleaner (or make things possible).  

If it feels like there should be a way to do something, and it would be useful to you, look it up, see if there is a way.

It reminds me of another crazy idea though: create a ledger for debts and let the community build various coexisting gift economy systems on top.

1. The ledger only stores debts between accounts. Zero is the default, `2^64-1` is the maximum.
2. Two accounts can together agree to change the balance between them however they want.
3. Transactions form something like a DAG. Everything is voluntary, so there's little need for the ledger to actually reach consensus. Let other layers worry about it.

Such a system would have no speculative value and would not work as a value transfer mechanism by itself because anyone can create two accounts and set balance between them to `2^64-1`.

However it may work as a mechanism for scaling real world trust, similar to [Hawala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawala) and other [informal value transfer systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_value_transfer_system).

If Alice and Bob have a relationship and Bob and Charlie have a relationship but Alice and Charlie don't want a relationship, then Bob can be an intermediary when Alice wants to sell something to Charlie. Charlie declares debt to Bob, Bob declares debt to Alice, Alice hands over the goods off-chain.

The same process can be automated for chains of any length. The only requirement is that an escrow hands over Alice's goods to Charlie at the same time Charlie confirms the chain trade.

TL;DR: automate debt accounting in a decentralized way. No enforcement, just accounting. Intuitively it feels like something that has no reason not to work.",1642102177.0,1

Say that one week there's a few strains, and the only difference between them is the transaction fee that goes to the miner/staker. One strain is set at 0, one at some other value, and one at a massively high other value. The producers will choose not to support the 0-payout strain, so it'll die. And on the other hand, the consumers won't choose the massively high fee strain, so it'll die. Eventually, consensus will settle on a fair price for the transaction... but even if a consumer for some reason decided to pay the higher price (maybe in exchange for a expected faster transfer?), then that would still get put on the common ledger, just with a different set of rules applied (higher fee being the different rule). Another strain might support some kind of new technology, but might also incur some additional fee. A strain like this might stay around for a long time, being used by people interested in the new tech who want to pay the fee, but ignored by people who aren't interested in using that tech. Either way, all transfers get written to the same master ledger.

&#x200B;

Well I think there's a few reasons.

A) It helps to quickly achieve a viable compromise because there's new forks being made all the time and old ones getting destroyed.

B) It unites these chains into one chain with variable, simultaneous rules. There's no need to pick between btc or ltc in the long term, because you just have coin and choose which rules you want to follow for each exchange. Your coin is immortal, even if the rules that were in governance when you bought it are no longer around.

C) It prevents the exact thing you bring up. Having old tech like btc and classic eth hanging around crowds the space, and puts money in inferior technology. In an ecosystem like the one I propose, a coin like btc would probably have died off a long time ago - only to be replaced with something much better for the producers and consumers. More people get to use better technology, which leads to faster adoption.

D) This produces rule governance like 3rd gen coins always try to achieve, but without actual voting or governance. Even coins like btc, eth, ada still have hard fast rules and ""commands handed down from above"" that neither the producer nor the consumer have any influence over. By distributing power to those who use it, the people who use it can mold the product to fit their interests. The same is true for producers (miners/stakers) who now have some influence over their own life. Agency produces action. Here, the consumer and producer are both given agency and opportunity to shape their own future. And even better, the two are forced to compromise towards a solution which works for both of them.",1642081685.0,-1

This goes against what a blockchain, let alone network is used for.

Programs want just enough data so they can do the computation themselves- not doing computation all the time on the network. Crypto does this because of the protocol which encrypts everything before going on chain.

Thats not to say someone cant make a crypto protocol where you could encrypt videos and stream it over the network (thats what tunneling actually is) but its very slow, cumbersome and has some infrastructure requirements.",1642009798.0,1

The premise is that content creators can post content and set a price in FileCoins. The media is encrypted prior to posting to IPFS. Consumers would need to pay for an unlock key. The unlock keys are based on the consumer's public key, therefore can't be shared or reused by others. Now for the ""mining"" part. When someone downloads the content, they are getting it from IPFS, a distributed network of storage providers (seeds). When someone pays for the unlock code, the network scans to see who is seeding the file and gives half the rewards to them and half to the content creator. So, if you want the content for ""free"", you need to seed it to many others. The seeding part is optional, it is a cost in storage and bandwidth to the user. 

Users can also seed other content that they never intend to unlock just to earn FileCoin in order to unlock a file of their choice at a later date. It's also similar to the model of BAT. In BAT, you watch ads to earn BAT then you later spend BAT to view premium content.

As for protections, I think the only thing FileCoin could do is prevent duplicate hashes from being posted. I wouldn't be able to download your media, unlock it, then post it as my own... Unless I changed a bit of information to change the hash. It is currently impossible to prevent someone from stealing your content once they have it unlocked on their own computer.

Also, with people having computers that mine at varying efficiencies, you then have a creator being paid differently per every view, even though in theory every view should essentially generate the same revenue.

I saw that you addressed this by saying how it could be minute amounts of crypto to not tax the computer, however, you then sort of create the problem that creators have with Youtube and Spotify. You'll then need mass amounts of views to really have any sort of financial gain, except now there won't be an algorithm that helps you create this virality and gain these views.

“Would you use Youtube if every video you watched, arbitrary code by the video creator is run?”

No, but… this wouldn’t be “arbitrary” code. It would be an established system that people agree to use, and the only thing that would change from video to video or creator to creator is the content and/or the wallet the crypto is being sent to. That’s it. Everything else would be as consistent, verifiable and consented to as using a certain video codec to watch a certain video format. What’s “arbitrary” about that?

I’ve already addressed the concern about trojans, malware and piracy, and how they’re already a problem with every form of content distribution we already use.

Nothing’s stopping Disney from putting malware into the code for streaming Disney+ content or downloading a piece of paid content… except for the fact that if they did that, people would find out and nobody would use Disney+ anymore.

Nothing’s stopping people from putting malware into torrent files on The Pirate Bay. And they do! But guess what?! People still take their chances and download pirated torrents every damn day, learning to avoid certain uploaders if they gain a bad reputation, etc… but there’s still tons of trusted content that is clean and accessible, and most importantly FREE at the point of transaction, which is why so many people continue to pirate content. 

That is pretty much all I want. That exact same model as the torrent/piracy system, except in a legitimate, legal system that would ensure the content owners get paid for their work, instead of getting nothing like they currently do from pirated torrents. They’d be the ones uploading their own content, instead of pirates who stole it.

And again, even if pirates do still steal it and try to upload on the same system (which wouldn’t work anyway, because the system wouldn’t verify a duplicate upload from someone else), or on some other platform, what could a pirate offer to people that would make them want to download their copy of the file, instead of the creator’s copy? Nothing. Because the creator’s copy is every bit as free and accessible, with the added advantage of having legitimacy and reputation behind it. If a creator so chose, they could find whoever uploaded the pirated version, because the blockchain would provide a public record of it, and charge them for stealing content, just as you would with any copyright infringement done via today’s technology. The public record of the blockchain would itself be a disincentive to pirate, on top of there already being less of an incentive to pirate already-free-and-accessible content. For the same reason most Youtubers don’t have to worry about their content being pirated, the content already being free tends to nip the desire for a pirated version in the bud. People pirate Netflix stuff, though, because Netflix has a subscription paywall. This is why the no-cost-to-the-consumer part is so important.

“Do you know about the log4j exploit? It’s similar in that this would open a window to remote code execution.”

Okay, I get that this is a potential risk, but again… why is that different for this idea than it already is anything and everything that people download and use on their computers? How is it so much more of a concern for this than it is for, say, downloading and running a node for the PI Network, for example, or any other blockchain? How is it more of a risk than what a lot of creators already do by selling a downloadable MP4 through their website?

I mean, is this not what blockchain technology is all about? A system of verification via nodes on a network of computers? The technology/coding expertise needed to figure how to make it as secure as possible would be a given in developing this idea, but I feel like a lot of that work has already been done in blockchains of various uses. What you’re asking me is essentially the same as asking why Bitcoin should be trusted. Does installing a Bitcoin wallet and transferring Bitcoin to it not open these same type of concerns? If not, why not? If so, why doesn’t it invalidate mining or storing Bitcoin, but it invalidates watching videos via the same type of system?

841,CryptoTechnology,Would this be possible?,AWS-77,1641991253.0,176,14,0.63,"Well yeah, the idea is entirely based on the collective mining power of as many viewers as you can get. The consumers would be completely aware of this and agree to it and everything, so I don't know why you're characterizing it as ""malware"". Malware is malware because it's ""malicious"", as in people don't want it in their computers because it does damage or slows things down and often they don't even know about it or can't get rid of it. This wouldn't be anything like that, so how is it malware?

The consumer would download the file and when they open it, they're met with a dialog box that says something like ""Playing this file will run a crypto-miner for the duration of the content. Do you consent?"" ... if they don't, they don't do it. If they do, they click Yes, and the file checks with the system to verify the file is legit and untampered with, passes copyright checks, etc, and then plays it. The miner runs in tandem with the playing of the file, so imagine you make a 10-minute video, so 10-minutes of mining time per view, and get as much as 1000 viewers to view it... that's 10,000 minutes of mining time on your video. Now imagine you get a million views. A hundred million views. A billion views. Like I said, it wouldn't have to be much mined per view for it to add up to a big sum for the creator. If you don't get many views, you don't get many rewards, but what else is new in the world of content monetization?

The concern about people with more powerful machines hogging all the rewards doesn't seem relevant, when the rewards are going to the creator anyway, from wherever they happen to be when they're mined. I'd think that would actually discourage people from lending more processing power than they would need to just to get the video to play, because there'd be no incentive for them to if they're not getting the rewards. They just want the video to play. You could set like a base minimum amount of processing power that's required to verify the file and ensure a base amount of mining, and then add the option to allow more processing power than that, if you wanted, which would raise the collective mining power and generate more rewards for the creator per view, so it'd be an act of generosity on the viewer's behalf to donate their processing power, which I'd imagine people would do if they really like a creator (could even include a tipping option as well if they want to be even more generous). As long as the minimum is an amount that the average iPhone could do (which, come on, those things are getting pretty impressively powerful now and only increasing going forward), then it would be enough to make the system work and get some amount of mining rewards out of each view. If the person's device isn't powerful enough to even reach the minimum, then it would have to be a pretty old device and they should accept the consequences of their lagging on keeping up with technology, the same as if your old phone doesn't support a new app or OS.

So looking at it this way, if the average processing power across all viewers' devices was enough to generate, say, a cent's worth of crypto for about 10 minutes of viewing, then if you got a million views, you'd have a thousand bucks for 1 million views on a 10 minute video. The same for half a million views on a 20 minute video and so forth. Feature films could generate around $120,000 from a million views at that rate. Now imagine the value of the cryptocurrecy goes up to make it so you're mining $1 worth for 10 minutes of viewing. A 2-hour movie now makes $12 million from only 1 million views. A 3-hour movie makes $18 million. Now imagine you're Hollywood, where you can attract tens of millions or hundreds of millions of viewers with movies that people will watch again and again for years to come... think major studios and rich filmmakers might be interested in investing at this point? Crypto price goes up, rewards go up... so on and so on.

Maybe those amounts are overly-optimistic, but it would all depend on how well the cryptocurrecy's price does, and like I said, if the system attracted the attention of the likes of Hollywood, Bollywood, the music industry, television studios, news media, etc... that price could get pretty damn high with not a lot of mining needed per view to generate substantial rewards from mass amounts of views.",1642088757.0,1

Unfortunately, blockchain is often an over engineered solution that is awaiting a problem. Not everything should be on blockchain even if it sounds good at first.

&#x200B;

>The inspiration for the idea came from a mix of the Brave Browser and NFTs, so I just assume crypto is the arena in which this idea would work best.

The basic attention token (BAT) is pretty much as close as a solution creators can get to getting paid in a safe and reliable way for their content. It trades off reliance to third party advertisers to user safety and ease of use. In a sense, your proposed idea is similar to brave but with this balance tweaked.

&#x200B;

>With your suggestion of shasum, does it have the same decentralization and public ledger security that blockchain offers?

shasum is a checksum  program that can produce a deterministic hash string given the same input. This could be used in combination with digital signatures to verify that the file contents + signature is valid making files linked to their original creator as long as the file and signature have not been modified. This is not hard to implement using existing code libraries. It is decentralized (trustless) in that the user is able to verify for themselves that a file is untampered. This would just be a technique that could be integrated into the entire ecosystem but does not offer middle man less content payments.

&#x200B;

>What’s “arbitrary” about that?

It's arbitrary in that it would be different for each file. Each file/content creator would have to set their own crypto mining script to run. And people with bad intent can do much worse than having a crypto miner run while the file is open.

&#x200B;

>And again, even if pirates do still steal it and try to upload on the same system (which wouldn’t work anyway, because the system wouldn’t verify a duplicate upload from someone else)

Your file system will still use existing file formats such as mp4 for videos and mp3 for audio under the layer of abstraction the new format provides. People can and definitely will extract the underlying content though reverse engineering or what not to extract the raw content. Then these files can be wrapped in your new file again but with the pirate's payout address.

&#x200B;

>what could a pirate offer to people that would make them want to download their copy of the file, instead of the creator’s copy?

The pirate's copy is there to deceive unsuspecting people and ""steal"" views from the original creator.

&#x200B;

>If a creator so chose, they could find whoever uploaded the pirated version, because the blockchain would provide a public record of it, and charge them for stealing content, just as you would with any copyright infringement done via today’s technology.

You seem to want the files tracked via blockchain. But what is the merit in tracking static files on a decentralised server? Again, blockchain is overkill for your idea. Also, just from the nature of blockchain and international law, the creator won't be able to find out who the pirates are and take them to court. A content publisher, whether original or pirate, will always just be a public key represented on the blockchain making it impossible to find out who owns the public key.

&#x200B;

>why is that different for this idea than it already is anything and everything that people download and use on their computers?

Because the file type you have proposed is an EXECUTABLE script/program with attached content. People go around torrenting movies off the internet because the file format is just a multimedia storage dump where no code is executed. A crypto miner is fundamentally a script that runs on a computer where as a MP4 file is a bunch of data that is interpreted and displayed by a MP4 player. It has no other capabilities that storing data.

&#x200B;

>Does installing a Bitcoin wallet and transferring Bitcoin to it not open these same type of concerns?

Because Bitcoin wallets don't execute crypto miners or any other arbitrarily set code. Your system would be similar to having bitcoin wallets that allow people to send code fragments to each other and then having those fragments executed on the recipients machine when they open their wallet.

&#x200B;

>All that’s different is the code would contain the data that makes up a video instead of a Bitcoin token

That's what you are misunderstand. When you make or receive a bitcoin transaction, no code is executed on your local hardware where as with your system, a crypto miner, which is CODE, is executed on your machine. The difference being, the file affects your machine where as a bitcoin transaction cannot. There cannot be a zero trust model going on when you have to trust the content creator that they haven't included malicious code in their content.

&#x200B;

I don't even think the piracy potential of your system is even an issue. It's just a side effect. The biggest issue is that the model allows for scripts/code to be executed on user's machines and the single point of trust is the file uploader. This is  a fundamental flaw that I would face if I was tasked with creating such a system. I'm sure there are smarter people who can come up with ideas to make middle-man less content payment systems or better yet implement your system in a way that is safe for users, but I, and many people in this thread, don't seem to think that is possible.",1642163412.0,1

In short: it’s a good idea, it’s just that nobody has been able to figure out how to actually do it in practice. 

As I see it, the crux of the problem is wrapped up with block rewards. Let’s start with blockchains that have constant block rewards - meaning, the amount of crypto mined per block is constant no matter how many people are mining.  The amount of crypto you mine is therefore approximately proportionate to the _fraction_ of total compute power your device has compared to the compute power of the rest of the computers in the network combined. With Bitcoin, this means that if you mine on a cellphone for a hundred years, you won’t make a single penny (or something on that scale). 

On the other hand, let’s say your blockchain has variable rewards, so that more mining means more crypto created per block. Here, you face a different problem: inflation of the coin. If the rate of inflation goes up as mining increases, the value of the coin may plummet. I won’t matter if it means that low powered devices are able to mine at least a small number of coins, because those coins will have so little value it wont matter.

Here’s what would happen in the system your imagining: people would mine crypto for themselves by consuming the content that they create, and they would do this with powerful machines.  (Nobody has been able to figure out a way of preventing this - for instance, it’s not very difficult make a single powerful machine appear like many smaller machines, so you couldn’t just make a rule preventing large machines) This would drive down the amount of crypto that could be mined on consumer devices - because it’s not about how powerful they are, it’s about how powerful they are _compared to the other miners_. 

I see how you’re trying to construct this system, so that collectively lots of people watching the same video will end up mining enough coin to be worth it together. So far, nobody has been able to figure out the economics of this well enough to make this actually work in practice. In the best case, a small amount of crypto would be mined for videos that go viral, most crypto goes to miners watching their own videos, and every other video would get zero crypto. 

This is why I said it’s well suited for malware. I’m not saying that your imagining malware, I’m just saying that it does actually generate money efficiently in a malware context. With malware, you’d gets lots of peoples devices all mining for you for long periods of time- and this would function similar to the “watching your own videos” scenario I described, which is how most coins would be mined. 

All that being said - it’s still a nice idea! It’s just that there are difficult problems that nobody has been able to solve yet that need to be solved for it to work.",1642111025.0,1

Because if so, then you seem to have missed the whole point of the verification aspect of the idea. Nobody would be able to repost content on the system or post copyrighted material they don’t own without it being treated the exact same way Youtube would treat it.

The verification would make it so that every file downloaded from a creator’s upload would need to be verified that it matches the original upload, or it won’t play. If someone tries to repost it on the system to monetize it themselves and cut out the creator… the system would detect that upload’s content as matching the content of the original upload, the same way Youtube’s algorithm detects and blocks copyrighted material. The same would go for posting copyrighted material that’s not on the system, where the owners of the copyright in question would have the same recourse they currently have with Youtube. Whatever the copyright laws in the country in question are, they would apply and be enforceable by the system’s algorithms.

I figured this all would have been clear when I said that the files need to be verified to work. It’s part of the reason I assume blockchain technology would work, because it’s all about transactions being approved by verification of authenticity in a decentralized peer-to-peer network.

I feel like you’re still kinda missing the point of the collective mining and the fact that the rewards go to the creator, not the people doing the mining. It doesn’t matter if a person with a cellphone doesn’t have enough power to ever get rewards… as long as they’re contributing even a tiny bit to the collective mining power, then that’s all that matters. To the creator, it doesn’t matter if the rewards are coming from a million people or 1 guy with a supercomputer… it’s all the same to the creator. The point of having a large pool of consumers viewing the content is to spread that around as much as possible, and wherever the balance falls in terms of who’s doing the most mining, then so be it. It’s not a competition between the miners like it is when they’re competing for the rewards, because they’re all just working together to reward the creator. I think that requires a fundamentally different way of thinking about it compared to normal crypto mining, and I’m not sure you or anyone else here is really grasping that aspect of it. If you’re saying that no current blockchain technology could work this way, then I guess I am actually suggesting an evolution of the technology that would require a whole new type of collective mining method to be developed. And yes, I realize that’s a big ask.


The issue of people just viewing their own content to reward themselves… again, so be it, if that happens. I don’t think that would prevent them from still contributing a substantial amount to other creators, because as much as I personally love watching my own content (I made it the way I like it, after all!)… I can’t spend ALL my time watching my own content. Sooner or later, I’m gonna wanna watch some other people’s shit. I’m gonna wanna throw on a movie or tv show or any of the type of content I’m interested in. Nobody would ever JUST watch their own content and NEVER anybody else’s. I mean, do current filmmakers who have movies on Netflix just stream their own shit all day long to rack up views on it so Netflix pays them more? Probably not. And even if they did, I don’t think that’s necessarily a problem at all. In the case of a blockchain, as long as they’re running the node, they would still be contributing to powering the blockchain with their mining, so even if they’re just watching their own content, they wouldn’t just be free-loading.

On the issue of inflation, I do see that being a potential problem, but not necessarily any more so than any cryptocurrency that isn’t hard-capped on supply like Bitcoin is (Ethereum or Doge, for instance). Maybe it could be hard-capped and still work somehow? But I figure not really, once all the coins are mined. Ideally, it wouldn’t be capped, so it can go on in perpetuity, and the creators with a vested interest in keeping the price up would keep re-investing some of their profits back into the system. And again, just imagine how much investment capital would be pumped into it if the likes of Hollywood et al got on board. I think that would overcome inflation for a pretty good while at least. I mean, for example, how long do we think Ethereum can stay valuable enough without a hard-cap to prevent inflation? For that matter, how long do we think fiat currency can remain valuable enough to keep the economy functioning with all this inflation going on? It’s a widespread problem, so again, if other systems that face these same problems have managed to work well enough for as long as they have and/or will… this system could too.

And finally, yes, I certainly understand this is all tough stuff to figure out and make work, but that’s why I came here to see what the actual obstacles are. I wasn’t expecting so many people to get hung up on how the system could potentially be abused, before they even addressed the technology behind making such an idea happen in the first place.

849,CryptoTechnology,Would this be possible?,AWS-77,1641991253.0,176,14,0.63,"So lets go through your points on how to deal wuth piracy:

Antivir software: all antivit software has a fundamental flaw, it can only find already known malware, it is mathematical impossible to find out what a pice of code does(called the halting problem). All known antivir software just compared file hashes to a central database of already discovered malware.


Walled garden: this defeats the whole idea of crypto and blockchain, if you have a central authority like apple(the classic example for a walled garden) they can just give out coins, you dont need to form consent between individuals anymore. You just invented a central bank/company that sells virtual coins and allows its users to interact with their API.


Maybe take a look into smart contracts like ETH does, that is code that can be executed on the blockchain/in a network of clients. But its not possible to realy do much with it.

Another intuition for you: As a network gains miners, each miner has an incentive to grow larger, so they don’t become a smaller percentage of the whole. This means the bigger the network gets, the more powerful the most powerful players are, and the more pushed out the smaller players are. This scales on and on, and is part of the reason you can’t make money on an iPhone mining Bitcoin. 

This is the problem at the core of the idea - it depends on the idea that nobody will employ huge resources to “watch their own videos”.  But such a system would allow someone to get rich doing this, so people will use it this way.  Remember that we don’t have a way to distinguish one person with a large computer from many people with normal computers (we don’t know how to solve it without centralization).

**DOGE is under active development**

You can view the latest AMA with doge devs here -- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jctze9jZfTQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jctze9jZfTQ)

Some highlights:

* Potential move to PoS
* Plans for inexpensive low tech, low entry barrier nodes
* Plans for native point of sale platform
* Devs are nerds that perform hard science experiments for fun.  *This is a good thing.*

**DOGE has utility**

Doge is not competing with BTC or the ETH killers.  It only wants to be a cheap and fast currency.

Fees have been reduced dramatically.  Doge is now one of the cheapest ways to send money overseas.

**DOGE** ***is*** **a real currency**

It was a phenomenon. SO if you got in early before that happened and you cashed out, you made a lot of money.

However those that are still in cryptos have lost 50% at least from the top, and those that got in late ae likely well under water.   Those that get in now are trying to catch a falling knife. All upturns for cryptos should be used to get out. It is not a sign of hope when Bitcoin rebounds from 33,000 to 36,000, it is a pause in the selling. 

Here are some facts. There are 15,000+ cryptos and 99% of them are scams and will go to zero. The survivors have already been cut in half nd may get cut in half again when world central banks regulate, and they are about to do that. Biden has an executive order coming in about ten days and it is well known the the IMF, Bank of England, money center banks, IRS, Treasury, Fed, even Waren Buffett are all against cryptos even existing, but they cannot totallywipe them out for instead they will make it law that no cryptos can be kept secret, all must be fully disclosed, all passcodes must be revealed, all crypto brokers must allow the feds to freee and seize suspect accounts, and all profits from cryptos going back years must be declared taxed and penalized if you haven't paid your full taxes every single year.

Furthermore, criminal crypto hackers ae having a field day. Lately we have heard reports of billions in cryptos being stolen by hackers. And those are the just the reported cases, so your cryptos are not safe where you keep them , and some of the crypto brokers ad promoters may be criminals as well.  Before he died McAfee set up cryptos designed to steal all the money put into them. How many more of those are there?

Anyway, if you insist on being in cryptos first I would cash 100% out now and then just wait to see what the regulations are.  Plus on you 1040 you cannot lie when the IRS asks you if you have ever been in cryptos, that would be a crime.  You must fully declare and pay back taxes and penalties on any profits you realized in the past, and that is when 99% of the profits were made in the past, like 6 months to 6 years ago before the house of cards started falling.

I would also advised that you take your crypto money an d put it into real stocks now. After the tech sell off there are great bargains now on great stocks, even AAPL at 12% off.",1643115789.0,-2

The biggest things NFTs are going to be used for are things like: Stock ownership, real estate titles, fractionalizing art/real estate/movie rights etc. 

Then after that it will be NFTs in gaming becoming huge. Especially for kids that were just recently
born. Imagine being a kid and growing up right now, every single game has so many micro transactions and all these kids think they aren’t getting ripped off at all. Now in 10 years kids in highschool are going to be buying and selling skins from each other and selling it to their friends either p2p or to each other. Editing this in… but also Esposts as an industry is getting HUGE, with potential to be similar size to professional sports in 20 to 30 years. NFTs related to these team makes it extremely easy to interact with their audiences like they do currently on twitch.

Well that same guy also thought that we’d still be mailing only checks to banks, ACH is too far off. Why would I chat on AOL when I can just call my friend… seems like it would never catch on. Why would I log onto face book, why would I be on snap chat if I have Facebook….

They're getting a bad name, and understandably so, but most people don't understand what an NFT actually is, and think it starts and ends with dumb pictures of apes. I made a post last week about an analogy I thought of with respect to the public's misunderstanding of them:

Imagine if the ball bearing was invented, and think of all the amazing applications it can have. Bicycles, computer parts, medical and aerospace technology, drawers in your house, toys like Yoyos, rotational shafts in your car's engine. But the problem is that to invent a working, reliable, and marketable car takes decades, millions in R&D, and innovation from the smartest engineers. A much SIMPLER application of the ball bearing is the fidget spinner! While the technology is brand new and engineers haven't yet figured out those applications yet that are actually worthwhile to society, somebody invented the fidget spinner, now possible thanks to ball bearing technology.  
  
And it absolutely BOOMS in popularity and people start trading their Ball Bearing fidget spinners for hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. Fidget spinners with different colors, fidget spinners with monkeys on them, fidget spinners in weird shapes. Ball bearings become synonymous with fidget spinners, now all the hype bros are trading their useless ball bearing toys.  
  
And now ball bearings have a bad name associated with them because of the fidget spinners, everyone either loves them because they make them rich, or hates them because the fidget spinners are stupid, which they are. Conventional media pushes story after story about Ball Bearing devices selling for 10s of millions. Ball Bearing manufacturers are obliterated in public opinion because their factory operations put out crazy carbon footprints. And people have the right to be pissed off, because at the end of the day a fidget spinner accomplishes nothing. It's a waste of resources, a waste of money, and a waste of time. The Ball Bearing goes down in history as a stupid novelty, and all the inventors and engineers trying to use ball bearings to serve an actual purpose receive endless flack because nobody has truly seen yet what can be accomplished when they're used in a real way.  
  
But people miss the point, that the underlying technology has an infinite innovative applications. We just haven't gotten there yet, and the current applications all either suck, tackle a problem that wasn't ever there, or are just plain bad. Real development takes time. It also takes failure. I consider the current NFT landscape a technological failure. Real development requires iteration, trail and error, survival of the fittest",1643122242.0,4

Literally nothing.  There is already a central authority with Microsoft controlling Minecraft, so adding a decentralized platform for it does not improve it.

> 2) Do creators not already get royalties for stock photography on traditional sites like Getty Images? Why would we need NFTs for that?

We wouldn't need NFT's for that.  Using a stock image tied to the blockchain is no different than copy/pasting one without permission from Getty.  No novel solutions here.

> 3) Is there a use case for staking NFTs? I don’t understand the purpose of veNFT without more info.

Literally nothing.  Tokens get distributed to people for holding.  It needs more money flowing in to the project for the value to be extracted.

> 4) What problem is solved by bringing Ethereum sign in to DocuSign?

None.  Current digital signing solutions are terrible, but most of that is because of poor interface, expensive subscription models, and inconsistent application across platforms.  Ethereum sign solves none of these.

NFT's are a problem in search of a solution.  There are much more interesting problems that the blockchain can solve.  Using NFT's for a platform that already has a centralized authority and is not able to replace them is not one of them.",1643127266.0,197

2: As of now, creators would get royalties from a Getty Images for the *initial* sale. If, however, the individual who purchased that media turns around and sells it to another individual, the artist sees 0 royalties. NFTs allow for the creator to receive royalties each and every time that media is sold.

For example, imagine if Van Gogh had made his paintings into NFTs. Even 100+ years later, his estate would continue receive royalties any time they NFT was sold. This is just a rough example of how it could be implemented IRL. Please don’t dig too far into this thought lmao.

3. The use case for staking NFTs is primarily for p2e gaming right now. I have friends who are, I shit you not, making 10-20k a month right now staking their [Creepz](https://opensea.io/collection/genesis-creepz) to earn the game’s token, [Loomi.](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/loomi/)

Admittedly, this is a *very* niche use case, but you can imagine where this would go.

In my opinion, people miss the ball park with NFTs 99% of the time because they don’t see the value in a media’s *life on the blockchain* in the long term. Obviously you could screenshot all of my NFTs and claim you own them. I, however, couldn’t care less about that, since I see the value in owning that media on chain.

Since people see NFTs solely through the scope of dumbass Ape jpegs, let me show you some projects that are already actually using the technology.

[The Red Village](https://theredvillage.com) - Play to Earn gladiator fighting. You purchase a gladiator and fight other people’s gladiators for ETH. You can also “breed” your gladiators to make new NFTs!

[Blockchain Miners Club](https://www.blockchainminers.club) - Owning one of these gives you ownership % of 110 (and growing) bitcoin miners owned by the project. This project has staking as well, which gives you their ERC20 token, $HASH.

[Zed Run](https://zed.run) - Digital horse racing and breeding!

1906,CryptoCurrency,Every single person laughing at NFTs today will be using them in 10 years,busterrulezzz,1643121434.0,1781,1137,0.57,"It's shocking how many people claim a use case for NFTs while mentioning a use case that relies on a central authority which renders NFTs unnecessary or useless. It shows they don't understand the basics of what the technology offers.

""ticketing"" is a great example.

the idea of a ""decentralized"" ticket is a nonsense. If there is no central authority to permit/deny entrance then there's no need for a ticket. Try going to one of the Free Festivals and charging people for a ""decentralized"" ticket and they'll tell you to go fuck yourself.

There's usually at least 3 centralized authorities for a ticketed event:

1. The venue - if they decide to close the building (or it gets shut down for some safety violation) on the day your concert is meant to be, then you're shit out of luck ""immutable ledger"" or no.

2. The ticket issuer - NFTs don't remove the need for these anymore than an SQL database does, which the venue could easily operate themselves for a fraction of the cost of any of the popular blockchains people use for NFTs. Venues don't run all their own tickets because large platforms like TicketMaster have huge network effects and negotiating power which is why they can charge such high fees because getting TicketMaster to sell tickets for you makes more money even after their high fees, at least for large venues. Small independent artist with loyal followings can and already do issue their own tickets because the negotiating power TicketMaster has is irrelevant on small scale where you can just use an email list and have all your fans show up at some small venue.

3. The band/speaker/event - If these decide not to show up (or die, or get sick, or injured), then even if the venue and the ticket issuer keep their word you're still fucked. There is no credible way an NFT could handle this except an ""oracle"" which is just an obfuscated centralized authority.

You have to trust at least one of these three authorities for any ticketed event, usually all three due to the economics of how events work.


People also do shit like claim ""NFT ticketing stops ticket scalping"" when if you look into any of these solutions its just a website that ties a personal ID to the ticket so you can't resell to someone without that ID, which you can already do without NFTs.",1643139392.0,18

But I have questions (which I'm sure no one here knows the answer to, but here goes).

Assumption one: the stock photos are just a JPEG (or whatever format is appropriate).

Normally stock photos are licensed for some sort of unlimited use on a specific page or group of pages. The image is places on a CDN with exceedingly aggressive caching rules.

Does this NFT approach somehow combat unlicensed use, or are the content creators still required to lawyer up to protect their property? I would assume so because of the above mentioned (?)

Is it literally just a block chain tracked receipt that some entity had purchased the rights to use this asset in their page? If that's the only thing it does I'm extremely unimpressed. The issue in copyright infringement cases is rarely proving that you've licensed a particular asset.

If this somehow is meant to address a per view licensing model, which can be difficult sometimes because these damn things are cached so aggressively, i don't see how.

Do they imagine they'll serve up these images out of a CDN (who operates this CDN?), and then write an entry into a block chain for each request? How will that be scaled? Who has access to write this data into the block chain, considering GDPR prohibits writing anything at all identifying the requestor into a public blockchain?",1643145209.0,3
1912,CryptoCurrency,Every single person laughing at NFTs today will be using them in 10 years,busterrulezzz,1643121434.0,1781,1137,0.57,"For #2, reselling an image you buy on Getty Images is violating their terms of use. If it's a bad actor, they could also just resell the image tied to the NFT. Unless I'm missing something adding NFTs to the equation doesn't really change much?

Regarding P2E gaming, it's something I've explored a bit, but the conclusion I've reached is it's just a gamified pyramid scheme. People aren't creating value in any meaningful sense of the word, it's just early investors making money from later investors, and as soon as new players stop coming in, the whole thing collapses.  In some cases this collapse is very slow (see SLP price in Axie Infinity, Axie actually has time to try to bring in new players with new features because they were so successful), or incredibly quick (see CryptoMines, which went $0.50-->$800 in a couple months, then completely collapsed in about a week).

Maybe this will change if some P2E games are actually fun games and collecting the NFTs in them is fun in its own right (I think God's Unchained is the only example of a game like this). But as far as I can tell the vast majority of P2E are just cash grabs with little ""game"" there, it's not really any different than gambling on some other useless meme coin.",1643128796.0,7

Think about something like ticket master the only reason they know that’s your ticket is because you signed up for their website and you wrote your name on the order details. Think about the same thing except for instead of venue using ticket master they’re just using some type of digitalized exchange (think like Open sea for nba tickets or concert tickets etc) you now don’t have to sign up for anything. You connect your wallet and pay. You don’t need to enter your name or any details about yourself and the ticket is now in your wallet. You walk to the concert they scan your QR code and you’re done. 

The thing is decentralizing things isn’t really that different functionally from centralized things except for right now because a lot of things don’t have a front end interface that people are used to using with those same services. Once decentralized stuff looks and feels the same as current centralized services it would be a no brained to switch to option 2 in the Ticketmaster example (it’s also cheaper for all parties).

Currently the system is set up so that you have a sunk cost that you cannot recoup once you buy the game digitally. 

I agree that steam could implement the above features way more easily than blockchain but they have no incentive to at the moment.  A blockchain doing this would actually light a fire on Steam's ass to set this up which is why I'm not against this. If you look back, the only reason Steam's return policy is as good as it is now was because Origin stepped up their return policies back in 2015. 

Another issue is that Steam is a centralized system and therefore, they get to decide which games are allowed and not allowed on their platform. A decentralized blockchain would have no such censorship which means access to many more games which benefits the consumers.",1643143289.0,2

You do not need to spend five-six figures on a bag, there are plenty of comparable bags out there at a tenth of the cost. You buy a Louis because you want to show off, because you want to be part of something few people can afford to be a part of.

So imagine any application where you'd need to prove ownership of something, and that's a potential application of NFT. Yes that's a big deal in the art world, which is what we're seeing. But think about in the collectibles world, or gaming. Music and film. Or with property ownership. Legal documents/contracts. 

Or even something like event tickets. Ever tried to buy tickets for a concert from someone online? How can you know whether they're real or fake? Well if it was all represented in the blockchain there would be literal, irrefutable proof of authenticity that anybody can check at any time, and you could also see what hands they've passed through and what sale prices they've gone through.

There aren't any real world applications for NFTs yet because it takes time for people to adapt to technological change. We don't trust NFTs, companies don't have incentive to implement them yet, the world doesn't care yet. But my whole point is that as we see more and more innovation with this tech, the strong use cases will stick out and survive, and the dumb ones will die.

Another problem is that they're things which can't really be represented as NFTs without some form of centralization, making the 'decentralized' aspect moot. 

If I'm buying a land title as an NFT, I'm going to ensure I'm buying from someone who has enough power over the land to ensure my ownership of it(be it a government enforcing a lease or the trust from knowing I'm working with a well known company that won't screw me over). This requires some centralization of trust to either a government entity to enforce leases or a licensing/regulatory board to ensure I can trust the sellers land title is legit.

Yup, a land title is literally worthless if whatever the local monopoly force is doesn't agree its valid. Whoever holds recognition by the force is the one who gets to stay and whoever doesn't gets evicted.

Even if people started recognizing NFTs as land titles you'd still need to fight it in court whenever a dispute arose, so you might as well just be using the government database because they're deciding anyway.

This is also ignoring practical implications that make the whole thing even more pointless.

If we decide to start using NFTs for land titles, what happens when someone fat fingers a transfer and sends the NFT to an address no one has control of anymore. Do we just let that parcel of land remain unused for the next billion years?

No, there's always some backdoor where someone gets to decide ""this NFT is lost, let's re-issue another one"", in which case whoever has the power to re-issue land titles is the central authority and you can trust them just to run a centralized database.

Occasionally people counter this with ""ah but even then a blockchain keeps a record so it would stop governments from doing any funny business"", as if A) public version controlled databases don't exit and B) you could live somewhere for years without having volumes of evidence that would hold up in court that yes you've been living their not some random asshole who works at the government land registry.",1643144460.0,3

The worst possible thing in investing in any market is letting your emotions rule you, a very very close second is putting yourself in a position of being a forced seller, be it because of margin or because you are over invested and are desperate for cash.

I put another chunk of money in on Saturday on my bets because prices looked juicy and things fell another 20%....oh well imo, I'll put another chunk in this week again and if they fall another 10, oh well again

Catching knives hurts but those cuts heal in time and your hands get calluses in the long term 🤷‍♂️

Always take the long view in investing....if things are down across the board that's the time to suck it up buttercup and buy solid crypto projects and companies....there is no guarantee that everything will recover, a lot of this space will die this year, all you can do is do your best to pick solid projects with good development and funding and user bases and hang on for the ride, but for fucks sake don't sell when the market is this depressed.....

I’d look for BTC to retest closer to 30K USD/BTC before saying the bottom is in. 

All of this said, if Btc can move back above 40-41K and sustain that for more than one consecutive close, then I think the market will have reversed and momentum will turn bullish. 

But what do I know and who am I and most of the people on here kidding, I buy and HODL. While I look for “cheap” entry points, I haven’t sold any BTC yet.",1643121516.0,1

The hash is the value that is found when a coin is successfully mined or validated. Chaining blocks together like that is the chain part of blockchain

Every node that gets this message from the leader does a mathematical formula (very simplifying) finds a value and sends it back 

Leader is just chilling and waits till it gets f (almost always the failure tolerance allowance but I can’t be sure without seeing more) + 1 responses. For example if there’s 100 nodes, and f is 50, the leader waits till it has 51 responses. XOR is an operation that along with other things can help mix the values together so each one uniquely impacts the final one hash value.

I use whitepapers as just bedrock information for a project. They help you avoid scams and make sure the intent behind the project is at least legitimate (along with reading through the code base).

Real world results is a better way to compare projects. Projects speed and costs often are different in practice than presented in the optimal conditions in a white paper. Better tech also doesn’t mean a project wins in this space.

There are some criticisms I hope others can address here. I'm happy to learn.

1. Aswath Damodaran said crypto can't really be used as a true prominent currency because of its fluctuating value. You don't want to buy everyday things with is since it might go up in value and others don't want to accept it since it might drop in value. Currency needs stability.


2. It's not a store of value. We can see that it actually follows the equity market so it doesn't have the same property as gold.


3. There's no end game. For it to actually be the major global currency, every government in the world would have to lose control of their own curreny. There is no co-existing. I just don't see governments doing that.

 
4. Every financial system need regulation to stop market manipulation. How does crypto address this if it's anonymous and decentralised. Well, the majority of crypto is actually owned by a small minority which means it's easy to manipulate the market.

 
5. There's been articles saying it's a scam and 70% of Bitcoin transactions are done through tether or other cryptos and very little is done through cash. So prices don't reflect real value.


6. There's been significant push back saying nfts are scams, especially those popping up in the gaming industry.

Fanatical Apple fans create anti-Apple sentiment. Fanatical Tesla fans create more anti-Musk sentiment.

Even if you're not fanatical, there are fanatical crypto bros out there, who eventually get on the nerves of someone who didn't even care about crypto before. The crypto bros are *at least* partly responsible for creating stronger anti-crypto sentiment.

I am paid to make things happen and, along the way, problems arise that I must find existing or design novel solutions for.

Sometimes its a good idea to bring new technology into the equation, but doing so is always difficult, especially if old technology already solves the issue. Maybe the old technology has a gaping flaw that we have been ""living with"" and now, in some new market, that flaw is a dealbreaker.

We live with the flaws because developing a new technology is a *long* process that requires a lot of iterations, design updates, etc. That new technology may require a solution to dozens (or hundreds or thousands depending on scope) of individual ""problems"" before it can be adoptable. Luckily, like any science, we are able to grow from the body of others' research. Of those problems, many are commonplace and solutions can be found as full-fledged language features or in popular libraries. Some are less-common, but had some interest and therefore research available -- the Bitcoin whitepaper would appear similar to these.

And then there are the remaining problems. Those that no one has explored or, at least, has not posted any of their research publicly. These are what I see in the Crypto market currently. e.g. Currencies based on proof-of-work have energy consumption issues, they go hand in hand. Any attempt to solve those energy consumption issues will inevitably compromise on *something.*

It's certainly an interesting line of research, that's for sure. I also do believe that the problems faced are worth solving. This reality is not reflected in the crypto market, though. That is because the crypto market is based on speculation and manipulation. If coins were valued based on their technological merits, they would still be toys passed around in research groups so they could be picked apart and built into something better.",1643122390.0,2

That, and crypto (and nfts) have yet to come up with a viable, unique use case. People are finding out that crypto prices change with the wind (and public sentiment) just like stocks, but do not have anywhere near the amount of consumer protections that stock trading has (nor do they have the theoretical tether to a real entity).

Crypto, so far, has been riding a wave of popularity, which has directly been driving the price - so this becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. This is often why people call it a ponzi scheme. I think many people are now sick of the coordinated mass pump and dump schemes, the miners causing a gpu shortage, and the huge amount of wash sales pumping prices, also.

The host has an obvious narrative rather than being an impartial fact-presenter. It's evident in language used (eg, calling the Winklevoss twins ""assholes"" - true or not, attacking someone personally is a logical fallacy that doesn't give any argument credibility). That whole segment of 'these morally bankrupt people love crypto,  so crypto must be bad' was honestly kind of cringe.. what kind of argument is that?

Some other things are straight up misleading - he talks about the traditional finance sectors energy consumption ""but it's for the entire 7 billion population"" - this is ignorant at best, or deceitful (see: his narrative I mentioned) at worst; currently there are around 2 BILLION people in the world that are un-banked. This is an issue that Bitcoin (and other Cryptos) are actively trying (and succeeding - see El Salvador which has no onboarded 70% of the nations unbanked citizens) to fix, which again goes against his \*opening\* statement that Crypto ""does nothing to address 99% of the problems with the banking industry"".

Then he goes on to mention Bitcoins TPS limitations, but doesn't mention a single thing about the Lightning network (?) which has theoretically unlimited TPS and is the scaling solution currently making payments in El Salvador a reality.

Somewhat related - you can see he's a 'gamer' from his youtube channel, so part of me thinks he is part of the 'NFTs are going to destroy gaming' camp which prompted the video, this is pure speculation on my behalf however.

The non-custodial, transparent, programmable money feature of crypto will be incredibly important. 

Protocols that can use programmable money, and *are owned by their users*, will add tremendous efficiency to the economy because it removes the misaligned incentives of the middle-man who is always trying to maximize their own profit, even at the expense of the end-user.

When Jack Dorsey was talking about web3 not being too far off from web2 because VCs end up owning the protocols, he was partly right. Where he was wrong was that it's still early days and web3 hasn't even fully bloomed.

Blockchain is a solution in search of a problem. There is nothing that Blockchains can do that a distributed database can't do better.

One of the main benefits that people pushed early on about Blockchains is that they are immutable (meaning that nobody can reverse transactions). That turned out to not be the feature people thought it was, because 1) people *want* their bank or credit card provider to be able to reverse fraudulent transactions, and 2) exchanges and blockchain developers have been more than happy to work out ways to reverse transactions when enough money is involved.

Another benefit that people pushed was decentralization. That ended up being a myth, because Blockchains have become more and more centralized around massive mining operations and (in the case of Bitcoin) whales that have enough Bitcoin to manipulate the market as they see fit.

There are some proposed solutions to the problem of centralization, like the lightning network, but so far they either lead to centralization or increase fraud.

Right not Bitcoin's main real-world use cases appear to be money laundering, funding terrorism, helping governments like North Korea get around economic sanctions, buying illegal products on the dark web, and fraud. The same can be said for most other coins. That's why so many countries are starting to crack down on cryptocurrency and even ban exchanges from doing business until they follow KYC (know your customer) laws.

So, those are the things that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have going against them.

You might be wondering what they have going for them, and honestly the answer is ""nothing"". I'd hop right on the crypto train if I thought it had a future, but countries are starting to outright ban mining operations and / or make it impossible to withdraw money. The *best* case for Bitcoin appears to be that it turns into a digital asset like gold, but even that doesn't seem likely unless the space gets regulated.

This has given rise to some really confusing discussions, such as one that came up around a guy whose private keys were stolen along with his NFTs.

If a stable coin doesn't goes through audits and follow their guidelines it cant be traded in exchanges based in their country. This alone will cause some degree of panic, and it isn't far off as US has already shown they want stable coins regulated.

And there is also the fact that 10-12% intrest just doesn't feels right. If banks give you 1% intrest on deposited amount they are giving out loans at 4% , and then keeping 3% as profit which keeps them running. If you are getting 10-12% on your stable coins that means for profit they need to invest that money somewhere that gives 14-15% returns, which quite frankly is insane. The fact that there  0 transparency on where your dollars are going just doesn't sit right with me. If something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is too good to be true.",1643099524.0,7

I got into one project very very early (VeVe/Omi) based on fundamentals and they delivered big time and are still going strong today, at least compared to my entry/average. And then ADA, I actually stopped my DCA at $1 average cost because I felt anything above that was way overvalued based on its actual use case, and turns out I was right. Love the project, just no way it was worth nearly $100b at its peak with only staking. Now I’m back to my usual DCA since it’s back to what I feel is a fair price vs their ambition/plan/tech. If it drops below this, I’ll buy more because again I think anything around $1 (and rising now that dapps are releasing) is a great price.

I also have plenty of smaller projects that are in the red but those are the ones I’m currently averaging down and DCA regularly because I still believe in the fundamentals. I personally feel they are currently undervalued purely because they are small cap and much more affected by crypto swings. So yeah, combination of luck, diversification, and what I like to call “fluid DCA” in that I always DCA into some crypto every paycheck all year long… it is just not always to the same coin every week/month.

So I guess my “I invest in tech, not price” is only about 75% true haha. I do shift my buy elsewhere when I think something has recently pumped like crazy and is currently overvalued… but I still never miss some sort of buy every week. As you said, it has served me well so far and for the most part when one coin is slumping after a pump, another is pumping after a slump to make up the difference.

On January 6, 2022, BTC’s dominance slid to its lowest position in three years (37.7%) since June 3, 2018. The metric has increased to the 38% region while ethereum’s market dominance dropped from 18.6% to 17.7%.
A myriad of other coins have seen market dominance changes and the crypto asset binance coin (BNB) has a market dominance rating (MDR) of around 3.37%. Tether (USDT) commands an MDR of 3.35% and cardano (ADA) has 2%.
The stablecoin USDC’s MDR today is 1.95% and solana’s (SOL) market valuation is 1.85%. The distributed ledger technology token xrp’s (XRP) market cap represents 1.51% of today’s crypto market economy.

Following XRP, is terra’s (LUNA) market valuation which commands 1.22% of the crypto economy, and polkadot’s (DOT) 1.03%. The $173 billion worth of stablecoins represent 8.30% of the crypto economy and the $738 billion worth of smart contracts platforms is 35.36% of the value of all the coins in existence today.
The $11.8 billion in privacy coins is around 0.56% of the crypto economy’s net worth on Wednesday. Meme coins, however, command 2.15% of the digital currency economy with $45 billion

We see the consequences of that instead of the state machine idea invented by Buterin et al.   Despite years of work, no working DeFi or similarly interesting applications.  There is no way around this.

Read the SundaeSwap blog about what they had to do to make an exchange, vs what it would have been on every other chain system (immensely simpler).  

The development semantics are very difficult because of this, plus it uses a difficult programming language on top.

yes, Cardano IS bad for having congestion, a perfectly predictable and predicted problem.

Every other modern chain/DLT tries to have high performance, having seen the past.

At least ETH is crowded because there is tons of value and a deep contract set living on it and lots of demand.

Algorand deserves to be the future technically, in my opinion.  But almost everything else is technically better.  It doesn’t matter how many proofs you make if you can’t get it shipping.

* smart contract capability just launched in September 2021 and dapps are just coming online. This time next year will be a better indicator of the success of the cardano dapp market. 
* They leave it to the community and provide parameters to adjust the performance of the network. I'll agree it's not ideal right now, but scaling solutions haven't been implemented yet.
* There are numerous solutions to the ""concurrency issue"", but to your other point, not everyone in the cardano dev community has revealed their solutions in detail. It remains to be seen whether or not eUTXO is better than the account based model. 
* There are parameters set around pool operators to incentivize them to do their jobs right, but I agree, more could be done there. There is a known issue right now where pool operators are essentially gaming the system and the only response so far has been to ""no use those pools"". While this is an issue, the pools that are gaming the system are known and it doesn't look like it's been a lucrative exploit. 
* Yes, the dev ecosystem is closed right now, but that's because there are so many businesses rushing to build on cardano. I'm sure it will open up once the market matures. 
* ""Charles has a bad reputation"" - lol.... this is crypto... there's a hater for everyone. 
* ADA briefly surpassed Ethereum in transaction volume and while slower than normal, it was not slower/faster than ethereum at that time, but it was a hell of a lot cheaper.  Again, scaling solutions have not been implemented yet. Let's talk at the end of 2023. If Basho doesn't allow ADA to compete with the likes of Solana, then we have issues.

Interoperability breaks atomic composability at best, and is impossible without centralization at worst. There are still no truly decentralized x-chain bridges, and because finality is defined differently for different chains, you can't really have one. 

It is possible the future is multi chain, but it will be based around a single architecture. And there doesn't really need to be more than one decentralized chain once we have a single scalable and atomically composable chain. There's still value in having additional private chains for enterprise.

Moving of any funds is allowed only after you sign a transaction first - which will be a separate window where you are given info about the TX, associated data, gas cost, total balance changes and so on - along with a button to either accept or reject/deny it.

But I generally agree. Sometimes I would just like to check what does a given project have, what are the APYs, volume, sizes of pools, whatever - but for quite a lot of dApps you do need to first connect your wallet to see all of that info, even if I don't have any positions and don't plan on having any.

There is also another annoying ""friendly feature"" of many dApps. Sometimes I just want to get an idea about potential gas fee I would have to pay for doing something before I even start doing that - for example I may look for a easiest/cheapest way to bridge a coin/token from one chain to the other. Following with this example I usually enter some bogus amount into the field just to see the gas cost and fees, possibly I'll even start a dummy transaction (which I will reject anyway) to see the total cost. For example I would enter ""100 ETH"" into the bridge UI to see the fee and gas cost. But more and more dApps want to help me with my stupidity and don't display anything if I don't have enough funds in my wallet... Fortunately DEXes don't try to be so friendly (at least not yet), otherwise using them just to check for effects of potential swaps would be a real PITA (;",1643116077.0,52

Example: LSD is one of the least toxic Substances known to humanity. Pure unadulterated heroin leaves virtually zero physical trace in the human body. 

Compare that to a pub or club where historically you've been able to buy alcohol (extremely toxic), tobacco (extremely toxic) and Amyl Nitrate aka Poppers (pretty toxic neurological!y).

The narcotics sold on there were of higher quality than the Fentanyl laced sh1t the CIA have flooded the streets with ever since, for starters. I'd wager the CIA have far more blood on their hands than Albright & the SR gang. 

Anything that could be deemed 'bad' for society that was sold on there is still sold now elsewhere regardless, and always was long before Silk Road, except SR provided a means to review sellers & quality assess produce.

People, not things, are terrible for society, and the worst people for society are generally in government, politics and finance. 

The way society has been allowed to be governed before, during and post Silk Road is far more terrible for society than anything sold on SR imo. 

Indeed, SR only existed because the powers that be had failed society with ineptitude.

Almost as if society didn't exist under a proverbial big brother that's always watching it'd openly market the products that it actually craves but can't pubicly disclose they do.

Drugs, human trafficking, guns, it all goes down right in your nose, and with the permission of corrupt goverment oficials that ultimately profit from it.

Reddit was very different when I made this account. The things that were discussed in the SR sub would not fly in present day Reddit.

But being here 11 years ago and learning about btc from the sub is why it took so long for me to buy btc (late 2017). 

What would have been an entry point for some was a barrier to me. I didn’t want to go through the hassle and it just made me feel like I would be scammed.

And because it would seem crazy to make such massive gains I would have sold.

I eventually read and learned about btc. But even the sub seemed like a joke—the wizard logo and the “magic internet money thing.”

It just seemed too crazy that such a thing would ever not be a joke. Not collapse. I finally actually read the WP, took time to try to grasp what blockchain was and believe in btc and crypto and decide it was worth it to jump in and never look back.",1643088390.0,28

He does say “looking for passive income” but 200k left alone in a vanguard index fund (just pick one) would be serious money in a few decades. With that sitting there you could probably not have to put away for retirement as much, making each paycheck more in your pocket (a sort of passive income, more take home pay). Of course, if you have a great employer who gives good retirement matching then maybe not worth it as much, but so few do.

I mean, 200k free and clear is almost “real estate investing” money, imho. Buy some houses (maybe 1 , or take several mortgages. depending on where you live) and mini flip them and rent them out. Sure, drop some into coins if you want but spread it out a bit. You could even just loan it out and make passive money off of that.

I know this is a crypto thread but dropping that much into crypto and not looking into other “non crypto” options is not the best path, imho (and is likely going to earn me some frownie points) Spread out the risk. Buy a food franchise and pay kids to run it and still have money left over to put into coins, etc.

Edit: I’m not a money advisor, but I would run the numbers doing old school investing and see how much you would need to put into index funds and just leave them until you’re 40-50.  Then you might have a decent idea how much money you can burn on any other investments/ideas and have a free and clear conscious you’re likely not going to lose it all. It feels good having 100 in the bank and 20 to burn vs 120 riding on one horse. Sure, the horse could win but the odds say it doesn’t.",1643149603.0,1

Zero gas fees on the network which is amazing, low transaction costs, a miriad of products such as farming, staking, lending and even leverage options.

The $425+ per month pricing is for business accounts. It includes things like direct connectors to ERP systems. That pricing is outlined here: [oanda.com/foreign-exchange-data-services/en/exchange-rates-api/api-pricing/](https://oanda.com/foreign-exchange-data-services/en/exchange-rates-api/api-pricing/)

However, use of their API for retail accounts is free. It just doesn't include any features besides accessing the pricing data. If you want to do anything else, like integrate their pricing into another system (other than Metatrader) then you're on your own.

~~Documentation for that API is here:~~ [~~https://developer.oanda.com/~~](https://developer.oanda.com/) Edit: That link is giving a 404.

Edit 2: Here is a link to the documentation. They have REST, FIX, and MT4 APIs. [https://developer.oanda.com/rest-live-v20/development-guide/](https://developer.oanda.com/rest-live-v20/development-guide/)

I had not traded FX in several months, but I just fired up my cloud VM and queried the API to make sure that it was still free. It was. I pulled both demo and live prices without a problem.

Also, their API does include a real-time pricing stream. I do not use it. If they have started to charge for it then it's not a big deal because you can poll their API every few seconds to get the tick data. However, I doubt they have started to charge for it, because I'm sure they would rather you subscribe to the pricing stream than hammer their API with hundreds of requests per minute.",1643045444.0,3

6341,algotrading,Question about high frequency trading,420stonk69,1642920650.0,58,55,0.89,"There are a few things to consider. If you have a margin account (regardless of whether you’re trading *on margin*) you have access to sales proceeds immediately and can trade with unsettled funds. Settlement delays will only matter when it comes to cashing out. However, you’ll be subject to “pattern day trader” limitations if you have less than a $25k portfolio, meaning you’ll be limited to only a few day trades per week. If you have a $25k portfolio in a margin account, however, there is no restriction on day trades.

In a *cash* account on the other hand, you can make any number of day trades but you can’t trade with unsettled funds, no matter the portfolio size.  Doing so is called “free-riding”. If you are primarily day trading one security then pattern day trading and free-riding will probably be dealbreakers unless you put $25k in or don’t day trade until you hit $25k.

Once you do “unlock” daytrading, there’s still a limit of 390 orders per day on average, after which you’ll be reclassified as a professional trader and additional fees may be applied by your broker.

Good luck! Make sure to post after you try it out live! There’s no simulation as accurate as just letting it rip and see how it does in the real market.

It doesn't need to be high-end (using a 1050, for example, would still be much faster than a CPU), the data you're training on and the size of your model is the biggest factor, because it determines how much memory you need.

Edit: To clarify, it's possible to train on CPU, but if you're working on the model, you're going to go through a lot of training, (using different model graphs, data preprocessing, etc...), so it's very time consuming. You train a lot because each time you want to try any changes or improvement to the model, you go through more training. If you got lucky and built a perfect model on the first try, you would only need to train once, but you wouldn't know it was the best model unless you trained some other ones that weren't as good, to prove your first model was the best.

The difference between CPU / GPU is about an hour of CPU training for every 5 minutes on a GPU.

14% buy/sales tax that distributes 8% BUSD to holders, 4% to marketing/casino, and 2% to pancake swap liquidity pool.

Scrooge is developing a play to earn casino, and gaming in partnership with Juego Studios which will be the central focus of the project. The casino is play to earn, and NOT gambling. Holders will be given monthly tickets to play slots, or Texas Hold ‘Em tournaments that will be proportional to their holding.

The smart contract will purchase any winnings in the casino that will be paid off. Everyone that holds also then benefits from every time there is a winner in the casino.

Scrooge coin aims to be a top 10 cryptocurrency and prides itself on transparency as well as the strong community that supports the project.

I’m going to be publishing my art for sale on Opensea very soon! What makes me appreciate this community so much is it gives the opportunity for artists to sell their art in an easy but simple way. Making hand drawn art to sell to a customer is extremely difficult (Artists in this business can relate) and quite expensive (Painting equipment used, the material of the paint, delivery costs, etc). Its even more difficult with two children running around the house causing havoc (of course I’m joking I love those little angels). In the end, the difficulty of reproducing my art caused me to burn out and I just do art for fun on the side with little pay. Opensea’s platform reignited my passion for art as it is a much easier and, in my opinion, cooler way to sell art!

The only time you pay gas fees is to sell the NFTs. Don't worry though its a one time gas fee. It's basically paying Opensea a fee which tells them that you are serious about selling. Once you pay the one time gas fee you can sell all your NFTs but you can only use the fixed price method. I believe selling the NFTs in the form of auctions run differently and are much more expensive to do.,1643131746.0,1

The price gets very hefty and I don't want to put people off with expensive prices on Opensea. Also, I would basically be painting it twice since the NFT was created from a previous painting and I would have to make a new painting and ship it. I do like the idea though.

1) Most of the projects today are scams which I have encountered
2) Most projects die out week weeks or months are launch 
3) Most projects will be worthless in few years.

But NFTs have great uses too
1) Passive income in some cases
2) Could literally make art , books , Moosic or videos into collectables 
3) Could have contracts like Gary Vee said - Like you should Turn an NFT an house and turn it into a house contract/ renting contract ( Though I don't like Gary Vee xD ) 
4) Metaverse utilities and for games (example: turning fortnite skins into nfts) Then we could trade them and rare ones will tank.

Why do we need Blockchain solutions for this? The desire for NFTs for most companies are so that they can attribute profit from the trading of these items, they do not care at all about anything else that NFTs could offer.

Yes, usually, and the more ""profit"" there is to be made, the higher the buy-in.

The difference between ""play-to-earn"" and ponzi schemes, is that in a job value is created, which is then exchanged for money from someone who think that the value of the product is equal to or greater than the monetary price. Then the worker is paid some portion of the difference between the materials required to produce the product and the price the customer paid. So - importantly - money comes in because there are people outside the company who feeds the system.

A ponzi scheme does not actually create value; in a Ponzi scheme, the ""early birds"" are paid with the value of the buy-ins for the next lot, and then they are paid by buy-ins from the next lot ad infinitum. The issue with Ponzi schemes is that they eventually collapse, and anyone still holding is left with worthless tokens that they usually can't even exchange on exchanges anymore. So - money doesn't come in from any value-generating activity - all money in the system are put in by people who want to ""work for"" the system.

It's very complicated and honestly an impressive amount of ""dressing up"" of the Ponzi-model, but it isn't any different. As with a lot (if not the vast majority) of crypto stuff, it's just the same old shit with a new paintjob.
