My question is because I have been talking with friends that work in tech and also reading and watching videos about Oracles and for some reason Tellor gets mentioned a lot but I don’t see anything special going for them and so I wanted to understand if they are worth researching more or not.

6,CryptoTechnology,Are Smart Contracts attached to a Wallet?,Will7ech,1642967459.0,10,9,0.85,"My understanding is when a contract is published to the blockchain it is allocated a ETH address. This address is not yours or mine, it belongs to the contract. That address is literally where it lives now. On top of that you can have logic inside the contract around who has access to perform the various parts of the contract. This would be established at deployment time. A contract is not something that is assigned to YOUR wallet like an NFT would.

Edit: fixed wording + to make it clearer, once deployed, you now use the allocated address (with appropriate arguments) to make the call to the newly published contract.",1642970170.0,3
7,CryptoTechnology,Are Smart Contracts attached to a Wallet?,Will7ech,1642967459.0,10,9,0.85,"There are two types of accounts in Ethereum: EOA and code accounts.

EOA(External Owned Account) is a ""person"" account, (in simple terms) has private key, public key, has some value, and it has an address.

a code account: is a smart contract account, is similar to an EOA but does not have a private key, therefore can't sign transactions, therefore can't start a transaction, therefore is a 24/7 computer program listener waiting for some EOA to call on its functions.

8,CryptoTechnology,Are Smart Contracts attached to a Wallet?,Will7ech,1642967459.0,10,9,0.85,"Well, what is a wallet? It's basically a piece of software that holds the keys to a certain account you control. 

When you create a smart contract, you're uploading a bit of code to the zero address, and that process will return the address of your new contract's location. Just the address, not the private key of it. No one really has the keys to that contract, it's programmatically created, hence it is immutable. 

So, to answer your question, you can't add the private key to a wallet. But it is a wallet, as in ""it holds money and can transact"" according to how it's programmed to transact.

What you can (and should do) is run a function when the contract is deployed that says ""the sender of this transaction [you] is the owner of this contract"", and then restrict some functionality to the owner of the contract. Check the ""ownable"" contract in openzeppelin",1642976225.0,1

FWIW Transaction ordering based on gas price looks like it’s here to stay. All the chains that don’t do it or that have very cheap fees are having serious problems with spam right now.  Better to have an option to pay a lot for a tax than to not be able to do a tx at all imo.

I'll copy and paste a reply I wrote over in /r/Hedera regarding Hedera's overall business model (and roadmap, I guess), just cos ain't nobody got time rewriting. Last couple paragraphs are the relevant bit but the rest is context.

""Many enterprises prefer a private dag network at the core of their infrastructure and for areas where they simply do not need public consensus.

These are designed to be modular and interoperable - this is more akin to tradition databases but built on the same kind of technology. 

IBM offer a whole suite of modular services for enterprise use in this area, with Walmart and Land Rover being some of the notable users. 

Hashgraph is designed to interoperate with these networks seamlessly providing public consensus or other specific functions if needed. 

The information is immutably encoded with no single point of failure, this remains very valuable - the private networks are more databases where Hashgraph helps create the internet out of them and allows parties that wish to do so interact directly with each other's databases with absolute trust.

In order to achieve this, Hedera offer the HCS - the simple and seamless capability of using the consensus service and nothing else. This isn't limited to private networks, anyone can use it if they so desire, as long as they pay their fees. 

This is useful for many Hyperledger clients, and you'll notice a significant overlap when comparing them with Hedera ecosystem partners (Walmart are heavily involved in promoting a new universal standard for digital coupons built entirely on Hedera's Hashgraph for example)

They also offer the HTS - programmable tokens at the native layer with all the performance on offer from the Hashgraph Algorithm (these offer about 80% of the functionality of Smart Contracts according to Mance - the rest can obviously be covered by the EVM and competing projects - if needed they can absolutely develop a superior smart contract platform but Hyperledger is already taking a good part towards this so mutual value is found.

The idea of modular, interoperable, open source infrastructure building up web 3.0 is the whole idea. You don't achieve that when one project wins alone, Hedera nonetheless offers value to the other parties within the ecosystem - that's what we're all about right? Cut out inefficiency and utilise the value gained. Just maths.

This brings me to the Hedera Smart Contract Service 

Hedera themselves aim to fully integrate Hyperledger Besu, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in the coming weeks - allowing Ethereum based dApps to run within Hedera and interact seamlessly with the Hedera ecosystem.  

Once complete, all the Ethereum developers have to do is copy and paste their code into the virtual machine and suddenly their dApp is running perfectly yet with the ~300 TPS of Besu. Kind of a no brainer as we wait for Ethereum 2.0 - and once that is in place the EVM will be able to at least keep up with the open source product, and likely continue to outpace it in the long term.",1642685654.0,2

Ethereum has been the focus on development because it's been the most stable platform - yet It will literally be far better to run Eth dApps on Hedera and incredibly easy with no real risk. Just an absolutely brilliant touch as far as I'm concerned and emblematic of the intelligence of their approach across the board.

Not a fan of Layer Twos personally, particularly because I haven't seen any marked advantages over a Hashgraph's native layer that doesn't come with a significant compromise. 

I understand you can make up for the compromise elsewhere but surely you understand why this becomes less and less tenable compared to a layer one solution which apparently achieves optimal performance from a mathematical standpoint in terms of security, throughput, and efficiency, without an apparent compromise.

Maybe quantum computing shakes things up, maybe something else does. Layer 2s are less speculative than that but speculative nonetheless

""Enterprise use demands stability in price - you need to write up a budget including operating costs so that you can see whether engaging in that activity is viable for your business. You simply cannot do that with variable gas fees, certainly not those of Ethereum-  and even Polygon's offering has been demonstrated to be a long way off with even a relatively small transaction volume. 

Why would an enterprise adopt and use a product that can suddenly increase 100x in cost without warning? Let alone one that can double.

Furthermore, HBAR fees may be fixed but the council can adjust them as they see fit. 

For example, minting an NFT costs $1. Avery Dennison plan to tokenize trillions of products, DLA Piper started out looking at tokenizing real-estate, now their plans go much further than even that. Obviously the adjustability of fees go both ways, I'm not hinging my argument on this particular revenue stream, the point is there's a lot you've missed, including other transaction types with their own associated fees.

Right now, for cryptocurrency transactions the price is fixed at (I think) 0.0001 USD. This is useful in its own right because it allows micropayment based usecases - a market which is completely inconceivable to you right now.

This is adequate at the moment as it incentives adoption and creates new possibilities. 

Right now the plan is to fund node operators through the treasury in the short term, if the current fees prove to be untenable past that stage, they will be changed. Adequately incentivising node operators to secure the network is an integral part of the design.

If, in the future, it is deemed that this particular type of transaction should cost more (or less) then this can be done. 

If the USD falls out of favour, they can find something else to peg it to.

If the miners turn out to be right and DLT is really just about paying a lot of money to miners and hodlers, then they can ramp the fees right up if they so desire.

My point is that this control Hedera have is a unique strength - you might disagree with how they've utilised it (I trust them and their partners a hell of a lot more than a random redditor), but nonetheless, the competing options are simply inferior and nothing else. 

They cannot be controlled or fixed because the gas demands are driven by fundamental limitations in the architecture of the other networks. Hedera's architecture is better. That's why they are being adopted""

Compromise is decentralization. 'One day the companies on our network will run more of the nodes' isn't even a promise to become decentralised, it's distributing cost/responsibility of operation but not to a meaningful degree as it's hand selected node operators.

That's OK because it doesn't look like HBAR is really trying to compete with L2s. It's competing with enterprise blockchain. The TPS, etc etc etc, should all be way better- there are only 20 nodes. Ethereum ~10k is a fair baseline. Again HBAR isn't trying to compete on decentralization, that's fine, but it does mean as platform there is a compromise. Its not speed, UX or 'security' from external forces you sacrifice, it's the ability to (hypothetically) spin up a node and 'fact check' what the team says/does etc. 

Also the EVM compatible 'just ctrl+c ctrl+v' meme seems to imply 'it just works' but how can it reconcile different EVM implementations? Sure I buy ethereumJS to HBAR is copy+paste but what if the code isn't JS to begin with? I'm not technical enough to know so I'm asking authentically.

Well that's the thing, with Hedera's governance currently decentralized between a council of 25 legally accountable, term limited, real world institutions - each running a secure and high quality node with independent infrastructure, certainly not hosted on AWS - Hedera is already more decentralized than any network in which a single party (e.g. developers/miners, even loosely associated) handle governance.

You could even say it's more decentralized than networks which run on only a few centralized servers in a few geographically centralized location. 

To make it better, on top of not reaching absolute finality, all of those blockchain networks lack aBFT security: a mathematical guarantee of partition resistance, verified by Carnegie Mellon in published proofs (I probably mentioned this but one more doesn't hurt - the absolute theoretical gold standard of security for distributed systems technologies.

And there will be millions of nodes, run by us, on our phones. Hedera possessing genuine scalability means they are able to achieve even that without compromise. You thought you found the compromise, but there really just isn't one. It's pure mathematical efficiency at every level. 

They are competing with the Layer Twos of other networks by achieving what they do at the native layer - Hedera's own Layer 2s will be built as appropriate and will represent absolute technological advance - not petty competition. For example, ZK snarks are one of the more well designed Hedera Improvement Proposal made thus far and I would expect it to be on the way - reconciling private trust with public transparency.

What you missed is that these are the conditions needed for the creation of a permissionless, fully distributed network down the line - these are the steps being taken to create that, and yes, create a product secure enough for enterprise use (which is a requirement for any application of this tech at scale - what you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet) 

Going permissionless straight off the bat without creating safeguards against exploitation means that while your network can be decentralized in theory, it is far less likely to be in reality. The truth is that the extremely wealthy disproportionately control these systems right now and there is no way to reliably reverse that. 

Effective and transparent governance - not something Eth possesses I'm sorry to say - is an essential part of the equation - even a fourth prong to the 'Trilemma' if you ask me.

When your system is dependant on goodwill it is absolutely and irreconciably vulnerable to exploitation, take communism - another ideology which people love in theory but fell tragically short in practice because too much trust was given in those who controlled the means based on their 'commitment' to the 'greater good'.

Hedera offer universal zero trust architecture for the world - much larger in scope and requirements than anything you are imagining.

I'm honestly lacking in terms of the technical knowledge, I'm not a developer and don't really know what the process looks like - I will say Hedera offer a lot of technical support - both published and on-demand. The HBAR foundation also has an endowment of 20% of the HBAR supply for ecosystem grants (based on fiat leverage, not selling the principle) - whatever isn't actually as easy as I say will certainly be achievable with that kind of support.

So with the EVM currently (Smart Contracts 1.0) Hedera currently supports most Ethereum based code running with the efficiency, low latency, and predictable fees of Hedera (note the predictable fees are rooted in the fact that you couldn't congest it if you tried, and would make me a lot of money trying). The tokens remain outside of the Hedera network however and smart contracts only run with a TPS equal to that of Ethereum- itself 

The Hyperledger Besu integration behind Smart Contracts 2.0 however is much more capable, fully compatible with solidity, with throughput in the hundreds of TPS. Furthermore, these smart contracts are now fully interoperable with Hedera's native layer - to your question I assume this means they're wrapped? I'm not too familiar with this area.

 They're even buying offsets against the (minimal) electrical cost so you'll be able to say your network is carbon negative.

i'm not a developer just a random who's very interested, I'll leave you with this: https://hedera.com/blog/smart-contracts-2-0-now-on-the-hedera-testnet (probably should have started with it lol)

Here's a sample: ""The amount of gas available in an entire block on ethereum, 15 million, is available in a second on Hedera. The transaction is final in seconds. No need to wait for block confirmations or have that internal debate if you should pay a low, medium, or high gas priority fee to speed your transaction up.""",1642910996.0,1

If they buy their HBAR 'fuel' in bulk and it goes up, they'll be happy, but then that carries the risk of the price deprecating so they will likely stick to the predictable approach.

>The set of shards can be arbitrarily sized, enabling massive parallelization of the consensus process. Notably, this form of parallelization introduces a tunable tradeoff between security and scalability: reducing the number of shards each node covers increases parallelism and scale, but decreases the validator set size of a given shard. This capability allows the system designer to select a minimum threshold of per-shard node coverage that achieves high practical security, while maximizing parallelism and scale by allowing a large number of independent nodes. This is unique to Cerberus and discussed further in the analysis section.

So they can *kinda* place the tradeoff however they want with the way their sharding design works.  But the way they frame it here is the misleading part, and where it reveals that Radix doesn't really solve any new problems because they don't do anything to decrease the overall load of fully verifying the ledger, so sacrificing decentralization as the network utilization increases and compromising its resistance to validator corruption by forcing reliance on third parties.",1642614801.0,1

These are incorrect - processing is also extremely parallel and only happens on the shards related to a transaction.

The Cerberus Infographic series is a great resource that digs into the mechanisms behind Cerberus cross shard consensus and the role the Radix Engine plays to abstract away dealing w/ sharded data from dApps and the developer.

[https://www.radixdlt.com/post/cerberus-infographic-series-chapter-vi](https://www.radixdlt.com/post/cerberus-infographic-series-chapter-vi)

The following are excerpts from Chapters 12 and 13. (It may be easier to open up the pdf versions to find text easily).

&#x200B;

>***Chapter 12 selections - on parallel transactions across shards***  
>  
>Moreover, one of the key concepts that allows this to happen is that of parallel processing. In a future where Radix has scaled to fulfill the DeFi needs of billions of people, the vast majority of transactions will involve completely unrelated substates, shards, and validator sets. Those transactions will be processed entirely in parallel across the vastness of the shardspace without ever being “aware” that the other transactions exist.  
>  
>But not everything can be processed in parallel. There must still be some logic that tells Cerberus when substates are related and must be composed in the same transaction.  
>  
>***Chapter 13 selections - on partial ordering***  
>  
>Therefore ideally, you have a network that’s intelligent enough to only order when it’s absolutely necessary, so that it can process as many transactions as possible in parallel. We therefore want a network that has “partial ordering”  
>  
>....  
>  
>For Radix, that layer of logic is the Radix Engine. It tells Cerberus which substates are related and must be ordered, and which ones are not related and do not need to be ordered and can thus be safely parallelized.  
>  
>So how does the Radix Engine do this?  
>  
>When a transaction is created, it must follow rules stipulated by the Radix Engine. Those rules stipulate that only required substates are used in a transaction, and that when new substates are created, that those are broken down into as many substates as possible, that still make logical sense  
>  
>....  
>  
>Because of the Radix Engine, nodes therefore only need to undertake consensus on the absolutely most minimal set of shards required.  
>  
>If events are not related, they just get processed in parallel, across the entire shardspace, which is so large in size as to be practically infinite.",1642658915.0,4

I don't see what problem you think NFTs for music is supposed to solve? You talk about removing middlemen, but NFTs don't seem to provide anything for that that just, letting people buy the song online using a cryptocurrency, doesn't already provide.  

If you think that they could help with DRM for audio in a way that isn't feasible for DRM for images on account of images being screenshot-able, you should know that the same can be done with audio (might be slightly more difficult, but cannot be really protected against.).  

(Also, DRM on music is against freedom)  

I of course agree that being able to more easily create/handle tokens that represent individual intangible things can be useful.

edit: also, if scalability issues are solved (or possibly using a permissioned chain with a large number of known entities, who could be held accountable for any behavior contrary to what the protocol dictates?) then the idea (which some are already pursuing) of using tokens to track what resources went into making products, in order to be assured about where the materials came from, and where the labor and other steps were done, when a manufacturing process involves materials being bought and sold between many companies. Like e.g. where did the oil come from to make this plastic? where was the plastic made? where was the plastic made into parts of shoes? The shoe company presumably doesn't process the oil into plastic themselves, nor the other materials.
Of course, these assurances would only be as trustworthy as those who made them, at least this would make it so they can be tracked. Like, if you are making a cake to sell, you can't generate yourself the assurance that the eggs were from a farm with humanely raised chickens without inventing a made-up farm entity to sign those, which people wouldn't recognize as an existing farm. An actual farm might claim to raise their chickens humanely but not actually do so, and this wouldn't solve that problem, but there are other solutions for that part. This still helps avoid the issue of the cake-maker making up the info about the source of the eggs though. (Because, the problem of checking if a farm exists is even more solved than checking if the farm raises their chickens humanely.)  

(to be clear, I'm not like, especially interested myself in animal welfare stuff, just describing it as a use.
Another use could be getting certifications that various steps in the process didn't emit large amounts of CO2, or something. Would need certification organizations for that, but still.)",1642553882.0,5

What people misunderstand is,

To mint an NFT opensea charges 2.5% of final price , same with rarity and in case of nifty is 5% and 50cents on every secondary sale, This may sound a lot but the thing is that all this gas fee should be there to incentivize the miners, without which all this would never happen.

 Also more users might/might not decrease the gas fee as this would lead to congestion and hence higher the gas fee faster will your nft be minted.

The main way that I have thought about NFTs being useful would be in a subscription/membership based model. Like for example if an exclusive restaurant issued X amount of NFTs that indicated that you held a reoccurring reservation, or just that you were allowed to eat at that particular restaurant. This NFT now not only holds value for the owner of it, but also for the restaurant.

The restaurant would gain an initial investment, and the customer now has an asset that will hopefully appreciate if the restaurant does well. Now if it does appreciate, then the customer could sell the NFT for a profit, the restaurant could then make X percentage on the resale, and would now have record of who the person sold to. This would obviously be a permission based blockchain.

I think that NFTs in particular could be useful for something like this because if it’s a smaller, permission blockchain then it would be easier to track sale and re-sale history. It would also just streamline some processes (re-sale, commission collection, knowing who holds what NFT) that could otherwise be a nuisance, or simply not cost efficient. They could also have an NFT verification system at the restaurant to prevent any forgery. There are definitely other ways to do this outside of just NFTs but this has been the primary way that I see NFTs actually having utility.

Ethereum is like a general purpose decentralised computer where you have a lot of freedom with what you can build on top of it and pay for computation time whether it succeeds or not. Tokens and non-fungible tokens are simply a code standard.

Algorand utilize the account model like Ether. The account model works by removing tokens from one account and adding it to another account in a transaction causing the state of all involved accounts to be a part of the transaction. Instead of being general purpose, it is developed for financial assets and has native support for it. This simplifies some things like asset transfers, has some benefits like fixed cost, and comes with a lot of features and configurability for assets making it suitable for regulated assets.

Cardano use an UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output) model, similar to Bitcoin, instead of an account model. To send a transaction you spend tokens as inputs and create new UTxOs. One address can have several UTxOs so instead of a global state of accounts you have to validate for a transaction, you simply spend a token as an input and create a UTxO belonging to a different address. Cardano doesn't offer feature rich assets like Algorand or decentralised computing like Ethereum but you can accomplish some of the same things by making a Script/UTxO that holds an NFT or Token instead of an account holding it directly.

Those minted on other chains are compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Some blockchains have a native concept of an NFT built right into the base protocol, and so a smart contract does not need to be deployed. 

As an analogy: there are some operations that your computer can do right in its hardware, and so it is not necessary to write a program to execute them. For instance, arithmetic like integer addition is an operation that modern cpus have a module for (the ALU). It is, however, still possible to do addition without making use of this hardware (although this would be a nutty idea). In this analogy, a cpu with an ALU is like a blockchain with native NFTs, and a cpu without an ALU is like a computer where you need to write a program to do things like integer addition.",1642711440.0,3

There are two levels of safeguards.

This ""punishment"" step is often handled by the L1, and this is the second layer of safeguard. For example, if you are transferring coins through some lightning nodes and one lightning node doesn't transfer the coins as promise, a lightning node can take that info to the L1 chain and say ""hey, look, they promised they'd transfer the coins and they didn't!"" and L1 chain will force the transfer or revert the transfer or whatever the rules require.

But this has nothing to do whether it's an L1 or L2. If a user signs a transaction that's what's going to happen. If the transaction includes a 20% *fee* to whoever, that's the users fault for not checking what they're signing.

Just like with any art—or, really, any item for which you pay more than the production cost—you pay for the story. A painting that was stolen and then found is worth more after the fact, because it now has a story attached to it. Someone can copy a painting, but it wasn't the same canvas that actually sank to the bottom of the sea.

Arguably, the current NFT trend may create some historically significant NFTs, the ownership of which proving your early participation. I don't know, I don't really care for it.

Opening up new revenue streams via resale commission. But the offering for buyers/collectors hasn’t been particularly great. I personally am not interested in the whole “buy to get access to our private discord” - and it looks like being part of an exclusive online club doesn’t seem to be enough now. The issues with theft and rip offs are a real bummer but this happens today in the art world. It’s just that with the blockchain everyone can see how much was stolen and what was used to rip people off. 

The more interesting applications do intrigue me though, as NFTs are proof of ownership having utility in the real world could add real value. Redeemable events, conferences and concerts, access to restaurants and physical goods all exist in the NFT world today. I’m curious how this will pan out. 

In video games the idea of NFTs gets met with a huge amount of hate - not just dismissal. Sure companies need to buy in and invest time to use the blockchain data in their products. But let’s not use the argument of “buy x here use it there”.  Today if you purchase a digital good today it’s account bound. You can sell your account but that’s against TOS in most cases and it’s an all or nothing affair. The company owns your account and can revoke access at any time. Some companies allow you to resell digital goods, but only through their storefront and limited to other users who don’t already have the item. Blockchain would allow you to send, sell or burn on any store that uses that blockchain (or send off chain). If your account gets banned or stolen, your purchases are in your wallet and you can take them with you. Again, it’s the ownership that’s important not the uniqueness in this scenario. 

Then there’s interesting applications in the digital publisher world. If you purchased game licenses as NFTs and could use them at any digital store, and buy or resell through them. The store takes a cut to make some money, the publishers get commission and you actually own the game license. But that’s all pipe dream stuff and not likely. An interesting thought experiment. 

Something to remember when people call NFTs worthless is that they are literally tokens similar to any other crypto based token. The main different with ERC-20 and ERC-721 is that ERC-721 has a unique id and metadata. It’s just that 1 ETH = 1 ETH but 1NFT ≠ 1 NFT. If you agree that ERC-20 tokens have value, given that NFTs are a type of token, then they must have value in both scenarios. It’s just that the demand is a lot lower on one side of the fence, right? And rightly so - most owners want to flip and make money and nothing else. 

It’s worth noting that the metadata can be changed (that’s how NFTs reveal) and that they normally link to IPFS, a web api or URL to pull back the digital item. So the image, sound clip, video, digital selling point of an NFT can go offline in some cases. Then what value does it hold? It’s quite a compelling argument against them if the thing you bought for can disappear, but to each their own.",1642347523.0,2

This is not true if NFT dApp uses IPFS for artworks storage, as IPFS is an example of a content-addressable storage technology (the address of a file is only its hash).

The hash of the file on IPFS works differently than checksum. For example, it is not enough to make a very small change to the image, such as changing a single pixel.

The intention of IPFS designers was to protect data against deliberate (editing of a photo, changing a word in the text) altering the data, and not changing it as a result of accident.

First: speculative assets just about always experience price volatility, often because of expected future adoption. This is the way humans behave, and it is rational in this specific way, even though it seems irrational at arms-length. Because this is the way people behave, it should be expected. 

Second: some real artists have made real NFT art. Kevin Abosch is a widely well-regarded artist (one among many), and he has programmed the creation of NFTs as art. Art collectors would say that has value in the art marketplace. 

Third: if you’ve been in crypto for a while, you must know it works exactly this way. ICOs start making money, then you start seeing billions of new ICOs, most of which are absolutely ridiculous. New joke tokens start seeing their tokens boom, then we start seeing more and more joke tokens. 

Fourth: crypto is irrational as part of its ethos. Have you actually talked to people in the crypto space? They make zero sense most of the time, and that is perfect in its own way. Why? Because crypto has always been about doing something so different and so disruptive—so non-sensical—that regular people would finally have a chance at participating in global markets.

1) (optional) have the contract which tracks who owns how many of each type of card, allow a feature where you can freeze your ability to transfer the cards for a fixed amount of time  
2) at the start of the match, player’s decks are registered (possibly using some stuff to commit to them without revealing the content of one’s deck to the other player, but still granting them an assurance that one has the tokens for all the cards in one’s deck)  
3) pass back and forth signed messages describing moves and gamestate (and timestamps), in ways that are verifiably valid given the previous state. In order to handle the hidden information of “what cards are in your hand”, use the same techniques which have been used for preventing cheating in [online poker without a central server] .  
4) If any player makes an invalid move, the other player can prove this fact and win (presenting the proof to the smart contract), tell them to make a valid move, or, if they choose, allow the invalid move (if more than 2 players, or if someone other than these two players has an interest in the game, then all players, or a representative for all interested parties, must sign the same message agreeing to accept the invalid move as valid. Alternatively, committing to this not being a possibility can probably be done by using some kind of proof aggregation thing in order to be able to succinctly prove to the contract at the end that all the moves made were valid.)  
5) If a player doesn’t make a move within  a given time limit, then the next player can submit a dispute claim to the smart contract, either where this would count as the other player forfeiting, or skipping their turn, and where the player skipped has a given amount of time during which they can contest this.  
If the player making the claim had previously signed a move which came after the move they claimed wasn’t being made, they are cheating and they lose.  

There is a substantial issue here, where by refusing to make a move, (or, by refusing to send one’s opponent the message describing one’s move), one could force the other player to make their moves on-chain, as you say, which would be problematic.

(Of course, wouldn’t need the entire game state or move description, just a commitment, but still)  

6) finally, final move is verified as valid by the contract (or, if this would be computationally expensive, committed on the smart contract with a claimed result, and only verified by the contract if the claimed result is contested.)

__________

However, a much simpler solution, would be to not even have a smart contract have any transactions during a match at all, where except when cards are being traded/sold/issued/banned/unbanned , the clients simply, check the state of the smart contract, without any transaction happening.  

(Why do you want to be able to cryptographically validate all the moves of a game with a changing card list? That is very complicated with not much benefit.)  

If you want to have betting on the results of the match, just use a 3rd party judge (or panel of judges, depending on the importance of the match).

I don’t think there’s much tendency for judges to cheat or be bribed in big card game tournaments.

And, if there is a standard simulator which encodes the rules of the game, it becomes fairly unambiguous whether a ruling is legitimate. A rules judge who was bribed would lose all reputation as a rules judge.",1642372165.0,1

The current BTC hashrate is ~200 EH/s, so a 51% attack would need ~100 EH/s (100x10^18 H/s).

The Antminer S19 does about 100 TH/s (100x10^12 H/s), so you'd need around a million of them.

In practice that's way more than actually exist, but it's just a thought experiment.

It's a 3kW unit, so each one consumes 24x3 = 72kWh per day.

The cheapest electricity in the US is around 7c per kWh, so at that rate, you'd spend 72x0.07x10^6 = $5.02M / day to maintain a 51% attack.

Of course, that ignores the hardware costs. The retail cost per unit is $11,500, so the hardware alone would be north of $11.5B.

Edit: I just realized that technically it wouldn't be enough to have half the *existing* hashrate, you'd need to *match* the existing hashrate for a 51% attack, so you can double all those figures, and it would be more like $23B upfront + $10M/day.",1642350989.0,16

They are not art, they are an asset. If you invest in an NFT collection you get more than just an image displayed in your wallet. You gain access to the community and depending on the project, passive income, brand awareness, irl events, 3d models, early access to upcoming projects etc.

And possibly emotions of community and identity. Many people still can’t grasp it because they didn’t experience it yet.

I think NFTs are the evolution and combination of meme coins and DeFi. Less abstract, more approachable and more appealing than traditional crypto. I got a free LOOKS drop based on my NFT trading, that is currently staked at 800% APR. The crazy part, this could be (more or less) sustainable because their NFT platform gives 100% of the trading fees to stakers. The high volume is currently mainly based on wash trades but they will take over plenty of volume from Opensea in the long run. Looksrare is a billion dollar venture in the hands of the NFT community. It's just easier and safer for investors compared to providing liquidity on i.e. Uniswap.

Why would a company bother with that? If a game is networked, it still probably needs servers running to control things, since you can't just trust clients. A more decentralized setup that allows self-hosted or private server managed games with smaller groups is feasible, but then you've still got hosts with control. A p2p setup is possible, but then we're getting into a really limited set of games and a lot more complexity for the net code of a game. If you have your own servers to power the networked aspects of a game, then why not have them vend such data as well?

The reality is that reading data from the blockchain directly is pretty difficult today without running a node on the network.

A potentially better way to achieve similar results to what you described would be for a company to have a fully public dataset available at all times. A simple readonly API for it works just fine. If the company servers ever shut off, the community can fork the last state from it and let that be the source of truth. Different clients can all individually fork off on their own as well.

False. Understanding what makes proof of work the single known way to distribute control without central permission takes people a while. Proof of stake has been around and recognized to be an irrelevant fallacy for most of decade, at least in technically literate circles.

Sustainability of completely permissioned centralized systems doesn't really matter if a permissioned centralized system isn't your goal, and if it is we already had much more efficient systems for achieving that for decades.

Also very few seem to grasp the incentives at play in Proof of Work systems which goes far beyond just hash power.

It's incredibly obvious that proof of stake requires permission of previous stake owner to gain any access to control since tokens have owners and stake owners are literally rewarded for withholding control forever. Needing central permission to control is central control. Not only can proof of stake not be ever classified as decentralized, it's literally incentivizing continuous centralization of control.

Proof of work relies on permissionless external resources (matter/energy) for this reason with unforgeably continuous costs for all making it necessary to give up control to break even. It managed to do something completely unprecedented and unique - to prove something was done in outside world on-chain. There is nothing like it.

This is not the case, proof-of-stake coins are inflationary meaning they print coins each block, in many coins, being a large staker means your coins only keep pace with increasing supply (assuming total value of the coin's market stays the same). Staking rewards are generally linear and proportional to the amount of coin you have, so you don't automatically have all wealth converging into a couple of large addresses.

&#x200B;

In other words, if you have 10% of the coin supply now and you continue to stake with it, you will still have 10% in five years. Your 10% is now 50 coins instead of 10, but it's the same percent of the market share.",1642300020.0,3

It's impossible nowadays to mine Bitcoin for the average person. 

At least proof of stake protocols like Navcoin's give each node the same percentage of rewards each year, +- 7% nowadays in which it doesn't matter if you stake 1 or 100000 coins.

This is done by implementing coin age, meaning that if you have 1 coin staking for a long time it will eventually stake purely because of the time spend staking.

Age over weight in this case.

I see it as AR more than VR. 

Imagine adding ambiance/decorations to a restaurant through AR glasses. 

Imagine Pokemon Go but even more immersive. You can have subsets of people walking around interacting with the Pokemon Go universe, where they see Pokemon around them to catch, while another subset of people are tuned into the Avengers, Harry Potter, or LotR metaverse, with whatever that entails. It’d be like LARPing but to the extreme.

Imagine coming home and your entire house is decorated with NFTs: if you want to rearrange things for decor, instead of having to physically move things, you can just move them virtually. You could have a pet dragon, fountains of lava, unicorns, mermaids, and whatever else you want in your home.

In all these interactions, the physical world would still be present, but you are augmenting what’s already there with things that are only possibly virtually. You can even tie NFTs to physical objects. So, for example, you could have a wand that’s just some stick object in the real world, but because you own the NFT for that wand, you can use that stick in the real world to cast spells in the metaverse.

Yes !!

I'm a long time gamer, started with Pokemon Yellow and up to today's games. I've always been a fan not only of playing but of the whole video game culture and the progression of game play along the years.

I was able to try out a VR game about a year ago, and while I thought it would be boring and not so revolutionary, I was hooked up as soon as I entered the tutorial.

So far I didn't dive deep into it because it's not really my cup of tea, but I was really amazed by the possibilities with a technology and games that are still young in my opinion. The immersion was great and to me it's one of the most important part for many games that are supposed to put you in a character shoes or that let you dive in a specific universe.

 So I want to try it out and I want to follow how things will evolve around that, and I think that great things will be possible, despite the fact that it'll probably won't be used the way it's supposed to be (like how social networks are bringing up so many opportunities but are used in a way that's useless and annoying for most).

i believe that as we go forward with communication and social experiences more apps and sites withove towards the RP style interfaces. i can definitely see Instagram doing this. there are many light weight apps and games that can implement a full metaverse/market system that works for the masses. 

you could go on and on with different use cases and reasons/ideas for metaverses but it all boils down to the original meaning and social interaction. there is this ome show called ""westworld"" thats based on a metaverse type. it's probably actually somewhere in the works as we speak. but that would be large scale.

# Social interaction

Online gaming is fun for the social interactions, not the P2E hype nor game genres. Social media & media conferencing is good (if anonymousity mantained) & bad (if IRL identity locked on). Why? Me personally more readily open up myself in anonymous & make friends in like, than being around bunches of elderly that always raise issue of respect & so called ""more wise & experiences"" in life (Hence the death of FB). We trancended the era of respect based on age, race, geographical boundaries, social rank; into respect based on open wisdom & ideologies.

# Administration

Regulations is important in any interaction platforms. However, I trust consistent regulation by artificial intelligence more than by human gut feeling. Guess this blockchain not entirely trustless. AI is emotionless (sin-less), almost to the level of gods. Yes, technology improve interconnectivity like shopping & services, but the administration rules (by single authority) the one that most people complain. Also, platform administration exposure to the users also allows more tolerance & understanding why certain platform actions are taken, instead of shear blame of greed or irresponsibility.

# Others factors

I don't understand the need for VR (some people have 3D sickness) & NFT (abstract artistic value that only the crazy rich can apprehend & accept) too. In game items trading might increase game interactivity, but I understand no further than that. For example, minecraft players can play anonymously (though certain regulation by AI is needed) for social & trading for some in game item might solve scam issue, but everything else is clueless to me.",1642309223.0,1

The costs of NFTs currently are outrageous and unrealistic. Current costs are not what a healthy metaverse would look like. Maybe for collector’s items. But who knows. They’ll cost whatever people are willing to buy and sell em for.

For example, if you have an NFT for a wand in the Harry Potter metaverse that allows you to perform certain very powerful spells, and there are only a few copies of that wand in existence, then it makes sense that it would cost a lot. Now, if that same wand existed in another metaverse and did the exact same things but was abundant, people could switch to that metaverse instead and capitalism would take over from there to determine the optimal price. It all depends on how well developed the metaverse is and how much people are willing to spend for a product in one metaverse environment as opposed to another. 

I’d be willing to bet people would spend a lot more for a powerful wand in the official Harry Potter metaverse than for that same wand in a random no-name metaverse. But if that random no-name metaverse has good developers that create a fun, desirable environment, then that wand could then increase in price.

I’m assuming here that there will be multiple metaverses because I find it hard to believe that there will be one metaverse with a monopoly on the entire space, though that’s entirely possible (could see an Apple vs Android metaverse type of thing happening). If there were to be one main metaverse though, you can bet your ass that any items that are scarce will be expensive as hell. 

I imagine there might be one main metaverse platform that will prevail over others, as it has the best design / SDK, and the majority of developers will choose to develop using their platform, similar to Apple with iPhones. Then other competitor metaverse platforms will try to compete and will be around but won’t be as prevalent as the main one for whatever reason (like Android / Windows phones).",1642115034.0,2

IMHO AR is much closer to the next technological leap to gain mass adoption (stable images visible in all lighting conditions) than VR (an untethered headset that’s lightweight and doesn’t cause eye strain/nausea).
In the short term it is more likely that AR will gain broader adoption (esp. with Apple Glasses, Meta’s partnership with Ray Ban, Snap Spectacles, etc.) while VR continues to evolve in its own niche (gaming, entertainment, perhaps some engineering).

Eye strain/nausea is also an issue of AR too. You need to solve latency and VAC for both VR/AR. These aren't unique issues to VR.

It’s thought by several psychiatrists that the reason the rates of depression, anxiety, suicide, and suffering in general is rising so much in developed nations is due to an increased level of dopamine from all the stimulation and “feel good” products we have. Your brain has to counteract this excess dopamine and it does so by creating periods of artificial suffering to reach homeostasis again. 

In my eyes this seems like creating a life that’s quite unfulfilling, but one that seems cool in theory. You can essentially make everything exactly the way you want with little to no struggle. Seems like a front to capture and hold attention, but ends up killing productivity and fulfillment as a result.

Slightly harder to not realize that one isn’t following when reading than when watching.  

The important thing is doing. 

Get an interpreter or compiler installed and working, and get a very simple program to run (this may be copied and pasted, though it may be better to type it in yourself), and then come up with the simplest change you can think of to what you want it to do, that you think you can make, and make that change.
(I imagine you’ve progressed past “Hello, World.”, but if you were at that stage, a decent first thing to try would be “Hello, Wokeman1.”)

 If it doesn’t work, great! You need to be used to that experience. Figure out why.  
If you get an error message you don’t understand, look it up. 
(Though, before you look it up, read it. I mean, if it is many lines long, you don’t need to read the whole thing, but like, you wouldn’t paste the whole thing into google either.). 

Fix the error.
Get it working.  
Make other changes, of increasing difficulty, which require gradually more understanding.

(Fix the errors you encounter each time.
“There are two alternating steps in programming, adding bugs, and removing them.”)

Ask yourself what you can do with the things you’ve understood so far.  
What would be something neat you could do? What can you do with what you’ve learned so far that is potentially surprising that you can do it with that?
What’s something you aren’t quite sure how to accomplish, but you feel like you’re close to being able to?  
What’s the part that’s missing? Break it down.  
Look it up.  

You don’t need to learn all the language features right away, but you should be on the lookout for language features that you aren’t experienced with yet, and which would make things easier/cleaner (or make things possible).  

If it feels like there should be a way to do something, and it would be useful to you, look it up, see if there is a way.

It reminds me of another crazy idea though: create a ledger for debts and let the community build various coexisting gift economy systems on top.

1. The ledger only stores debts between accounts. Zero is the default, `2^64-1` is the maximum.
2. Two accounts can together agree to change the balance between them however they want.
3. Transactions form something like a DAG. Everything is voluntary, so there's little need for the ledger to actually reach consensus. Let other layers worry about it.

Such a system would have no speculative value and would not work as a value transfer mechanism by itself because anyone can create two accounts and set balance between them to `2^64-1`.

However it may work as a mechanism for scaling real world trust, similar to [Hawala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawala) and other [informal value transfer systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_value_transfer_system).

If Alice and Bob have a relationship and Bob and Charlie have a relationship but Alice and Charlie don't want a relationship, then Bob can be an intermediary when Alice wants to sell something to Charlie. Charlie declares debt to Bob, Bob declares debt to Alice, Alice hands over the goods off-chain.

The same process can be automated for chains of any length. The only requirement is that an escrow hands over Alice's goods to Charlie at the same time Charlie confirms the chain trade.

TL;DR: automate debt accounting in a decentralized way. No enforcement, just accounting. Intuitively it feels like something that has no reason not to work.",1642102177.0,1

Say that one week there's a few strains, and the only difference between them is the transaction fee that goes to the miner/staker. One strain is set at 0, one at some other value, and one at a massively high other value. The producers will choose not to support the 0-payout strain, so it'll die. And on the other hand, the consumers won't choose the massively high fee strain, so it'll die. Eventually, consensus will settle on a fair price for the transaction... but even if a consumer for some reason decided to pay the higher price (maybe in exchange for a expected faster transfer?), then that would still get put on the common ledger, just with a different set of rules applied (higher fee being the different rule). Another strain might support some kind of new technology, but might also incur some additional fee. A strain like this might stay around for a long time, being used by people interested in the new tech who want to pay the fee, but ignored by people who aren't interested in using that tech. Either way, all transfers get written to the same master ledger.

And each time a miner or staker supports a strain, they're basically ""voting"" for which strain they want, and the same is true for the people using the chain. Every time they use the service, they vote for which rules they want to govern the blockchain.",1642082069.0,3

&#x200B;

Well I think there's a few reasons.

A) It helps to quickly achieve a viable compromise because there's new forks being made all the time and old ones getting destroyed.

B) It unites these chains into one chain with variable, simultaneous rules. There's no need to pick between btc or ltc in the long term, because you just have coin and choose which rules you want to follow for each exchange. Your coin is immortal, even if the rules that were in governance when you bought it are no longer around.

C) It prevents the exact thing you bring up. Having old tech like btc and classic eth hanging around crowds the space, and puts money in inferior technology. In an ecosystem like the one I propose, a coin like btc would probably have died off a long time ago - only to be replaced with something much better for the producers and consumers. More people get to use better technology, which leads to faster adoption.

D) This produces rule governance like 3rd gen coins always try to achieve, but without actual voting or governance. Even coins like btc, eth, ada still have hard fast rules and ""commands handed down from above"" that neither the producer nor the consumer have any influence over. By distributing power to those who use it, the people who use it can mold the product to fit their interests. The same is true for producers (miners/stakers) who now have some influence over their own life. Agency produces action. Here, the consumer and producer are both given agency and opportunity to shape their own future. And even better, the two are forced to compromise towards a solution which works for both of them.",1642081685.0,-1

The unlock keys are based on the consumer's public key, therefore can't be shared or reused by others. Now for the ""mining"" part. When someone downloads the content, they are getting it from IPFS, a distributed network of storage providers (seeds). When someone pays for the unlock code, the network scans to see who is seeding the file and gives half the rewards to them and half to the content creator. So, if you want the content for ""free"", you need to seed it to many others. The seeding part is optional, it is a cost in storage and bandwidth to the user. 

Users can also seed other content that they never intend to unlock just to earn FileCoin in order to unlock a file of their choice at a later date. It's also similar to the model of BAT. In BAT, you watch ads to earn BAT then you later spend BAT to view premium content.

As for protections, I think the only thing FileCoin could do is prevent duplicate hashes from being posted. I wouldn't be able to download your media, unlock it, then post it as my own...

The problem is that big players can deploy powerful machines, which will be so powerful compared to a consumer device, that the consumer device cannot mine enough coin for it to be worth it. The only way for it to be profitable is if many consumer devices all work together for the benefit of a single person for a very long time - the more powerful the biggest players are, the more small players need to work together, and for longer periods of time.

“Would you use Youtube if every video you watched, arbitrary code by the video creator is run?”

No, but… this wouldn’t be “arbitrary” code. It would be an established system that people agree to use, and the only thing that would change from video to video or creator to creator is the content and/or the wallet the crypto is being sent to. That’s it. Everything else would be as consistent, verifiable and consented to as using a certain video codec to watch a certain video format. What’s “arbitrary” about that?

I’ve already addressed the concern about trojans, malware and piracy, and how they’re already a problem with every form of content distribution we already use.

Nothing’s stopping Disney from putting malware into the code for streaming Disney+ content or downloading a piece of paid content… except for the fact that if they did that, people would find out and nobody would use Disney+ anymore.

Nothing’s stopping people from putting malware into torrent files on The Pirate Bay. And they do! But guess what?! People still take their chances and download pirated torrents every damn day, learning to avoid certain uploaders if they gain a bad reputation, etc… but there’s still tons of trusted content that is clean and accessible, and most importantly FREE at the point of transaction, which is why so many people continue to pirate content. 

That is pretty much all I want. That exact same model as the torrent/piracy system, except in a legitimate, legal system that would ensure the content owners get paid for their work, instead of getting nothing like they currently do from pirated torrents. They’d be the ones uploading their own content, instead of pirates who stole it.

And again, even if pirates do still steal it and try to upload on the same system (which wouldn’t work anyway, because the system wouldn’t verify a duplicate upload from someone else), or on some other platform, what could a pirate offer to people that would make them want to download their copy of the file, instead of the creator’s copy? Nothing. Because the creator’s copy is every bit as free and accessible, with the added advantage of having legitimacy and reputation behind it. If a creator so chose, they could find whoever uploaded the pirated version, because the blockchain would provide a public record of it, and charge them for stealing content, just as you would with any copyright infringement done via today’s technology. The public record of the blockchain would itself be a disincentive to pirate, on top of there already being less of an incentive to pirate already-free-and-accessible content. For the same reason most Youtubers don’t have to worry about their content being pirated, the content already being free tends to nip the desire for a pirated version in the bud. People pirate Netflix stuff, though, because Netflix has a subscription paywall. This is why the no-cost-to-the-consumer part is so important.

“Do you know about the log4j exploit? It’s similar in that this would open a window to remote code execution.”

Okay, I get that this is a potential risk, but again… why is that different for this idea than it already is anything and everything that people download and use on their computers? How is it so much more of a concern for this than it is for, say, downloading and running a node for the PI Network, for example, or any other blockchain? How is it more of a risk than what a lot of creators already do by selling a downloadable MP4 through their website?

I mean, is this not what blockchain technology is all about? A system of verification via nodes on a network of computers? The technology/coding expertise needed to figure how to make it as secure as possible would be a given in developing this idea, but I feel like a lot of that work has already been done in blockchains of various uses. What you’re asking me is essentially the same as asking why Bitcoin should be trusted. Does installing a Bitcoin wallet and transferring Bitcoin to it not open these same type of concerns? If not, why not? If so, why doesn’t it invalidate mining or storing Bitcoin, but it invalidates watching videos via the same type of system?

The consumers would be completely aware of this and agree to it and everything, so I don't know why you're characterizing it as ""malware"". Malware is malware because it's ""malicious"", as in people don't want it in their computers because it does damage or slows things down and often they don't even know about it or can't get rid of it. This wouldn't be anything like that, so how is it malware?

The consumer would download the file and when they open it, they're met with a dialog box that says something like ""Playing this file will run a crypto-miner for the duration of the content. Do you consent?"" ... if they don't, they don't do it. If they do, they click Yes, and the file checks with the system to verify the file is legit and untampered with, passes copyright checks, etc, and then plays it. The miner runs in tandem with the playing of the file, so imagine you make a 10-minute video, so 10-minutes of mining time per view, and get as much as 1000 viewers to view it... that's 10,000 minutes of mining time on your video. Now imagine you get a million views. A hundred million views. A billion views. Like I said, it wouldn't have to be much mined per view for it to add up to a big sum for the creator. If you don't get many views, you don't get many rewards, but what else is new in the world of content monetization?

The concern about people with more powerful machines hogging all the rewards doesn't seem relevant, when the rewards are going to the creator anyway, from wherever they happen to be when they're mined. I'd think that would actually discourage people from lending more processing power than they would need to just to get the video to play, because there'd be no incentive for them to if they're not getting the rewards. They just want the video to play. You could set like a base minimum amount of processing power that's required to verify the file and ensure a base amount of mining, and then add the option to allow more processing power than that, if you wanted, which would raise the collective mining power and generate more rewards for the creator per view, so it'd be an act of generosity on the viewer's behalf to donate their processing power, which I'd imagine people would do if they really like a creator (could even include a tipping option as well if they want to be even more generous). As long as the minimum is an amount that the average iPhone could do (which, come on, those things are getting pretty impressively powerful now and only increasing going forward), then it would be enough to make the system work and get some amount of mining rewards out of each view. If the person's device isn't powerful enough to even reach the minimum, then it would have to be a pretty old device and they should accept the consequences of their lagging on keeping up with technology, the same as if your old phone doesn't support a new app or OS.

So looking at it this way, if the average processing power across all viewers' devices was enough to generate, say, a cent's worth of crypto for about 10 minutes of viewing, then if you got a million views, you'd have a thousand bucks for 1 million views on a 10 minute video. The same for half a million views on a 20 minute video and so forth. Feature films could generate around $120,000 from a million views at that rate. Now imagine the value of the cryptocurrecy goes up to make it so you're mining $1 worth for 10 minutes of viewing. A 2-hour movie now makes $12 million from only 1 million views. A 3-hour movie makes $18 million. Now imagine you're Hollywood, where you can attract tens of millions or hundreds of millions of viewers with movies that people will watch again and again for years to come... think major studios and rich filmmakers might be interested in investing at this point? Crypto price goes up, rewards go up... so on and so on.

Maybe those amounts are overly-optimistic, but it would all depend on how well the cryptocurrecy's price does, and like I said, if the system attracted the attention of the likes of Hollywood, Bollywood, the music industry, television studios, news media, etc... that price could get pretty damn high with not a lot of mining needed per view to generate substantial rewards from mass amounts of views.",1642088757.0,1

The basic attention token (BAT) is pretty much as close as a solution creators can get to getting paid in a safe and reliable way for their content.

&#x200B;

>With your suggestion of shasum, does it have the same decentralization and public ledger security that blockchain offers?

shasum is a checksum  program that can produce a deterministic hash string given the same input. This could be used in combination with digital signatures to verify that the file contents + signature is valid making files linked to their original creator as long as the file and signature have not been modified. This is not hard to implement using existing code libraries. It is decentralized (trustless) in that the user is able to verify for themselves that a file is untampered. This would just be a technique that could be integrated into the entire ecosystem but does not offer middle man less content payments.

&#x200B;

>What’s “arbitrary” about that?

It's arbitrary in that it would be different for each file. Each file/content creator would have to set their own crypto mining script to run. And people with bad intent can do much worse than having a crypto miner run while the file is open.

&#x200B;

>And again, even if pirates do still steal it and try to upload on the same system (which wouldn’t work anyway, because the system wouldn’t verify a duplicate upload from someone else)

Your file system will still use existing file formats such as mp4 for videos and mp3 for audio under the layer of abstraction the new format provides. People can and definitely will extract the underlying content though reverse engineering or what not to extract the raw content. Then these files can be wrapped in your new file again but with the pirate's payout address.

The pirate's copy is there to deceive unsuspecting people and ""steal"" views from the original creator.

You seem to want the files tracked via blockchain. But what is the merit in tracking static files on a decentralised server? Again, blockchain is overkill for your idea. Also, just from the nature of blockchain and international law, the creator won't be able to find out who the pirates are and take them to court. A content publisher, whether original or pirate, will always just be a public key represented on the blockchain making it impossible to find out who owns the public key.

&#x200B;

>why is that different for this idea than it already is anything and everything that people download and use on their computers?

Because the file type you have proposed is an EXECUTABLE script/program with attached content. People go around torrenting movies off the internet because the file format is just a multimedia storage dump where no code is executed. A crypto miner is fundamentally a script that runs on a computer where as a MP4 file is a bunch of data that is interpreted and displayed by a MP4 player. It has no other capabilities that storing data.

&#x200B;

>Does installing a Bitcoin wallet and transferring Bitcoin to it not open these same type of concerns?

Because Bitcoin wallets don't execute crypto miners or any other arbitrarily set code. Your system would be similar to having bitcoin wallets that allow people to send code fragments to each other and then having those fragments executed on the recipients machine when they open their wallet.

&#x200B;

>All that’s different is the code would contain the data that makes up a video instead of a Bitcoin token

That's what you are misunderstand. When you make or receive a bitcoin transaction, no code is executed on your local hardware where as with your system, a crypto miner, which is CODE, is executed on your machine. The difference being, the file affects your machine where as a bitcoin transaction cannot. There cannot be a zero trust model going on when you have to trust the content creator that they haven't included malicious code in their content.

&#x200B;

I don't even think the piracy potential of your system is even an issue. It's just a side effect. The biggest issue is that the model allows for scripts/code to be executed on user's machines and the single point of trust is the file uploader. This is  a fundamental flaw that I would face if I was tasked with creating such a system. I'm sure there are smarter people who can come up with ideas to make middle-man less content payment systems or better yet implement your system in a way that is safe for users, but I, and many people in this thread, don't seem to think that is possible.",1642163412.0,1

In short: it’s a good idea, it’s just that nobody has been able to figure out how to actually do it in practice. 

As I see it, the crux of the problem is wrapped up with block rewards. Let’s start with blockchains that have constant block rewards - meaning, the amount of crypto mined per block is constant no matter how many people are mining.  The amount of crypto you mine is therefore approximately proportionate to the _fraction_ of total compute power your device has compared to the compute power of the rest of the computers in the network combined. With Bitcoin, this means that if you mine on a cellphone for a hundred years, you won’t make a single penny (or something on that scale). 

On the other hand, let’s say your blockchain has variable rewards, so that more mining means more crypto created per block. Here, you face a different problem: inflation of the coin. If the rate of inflation goes up as mining increases, the value of the coin may plummet. I won’t matter if it means that low powered devices are able to mine at least a small number of coins, because those coins will have so little value it wont matter.

Here’s what would happen in the system your imagining: people would mine crypto for themselves by consuming the content that they create, and they would do this with powerful machines.  (Nobody has been able to figure out a way of preventing this - for instance, it’s not very difficult make a single powerful machine appear like many smaller machines, so you couldn’t just make a rule preventing large machines) This would drive down the amount of crypto that could be mined on consumer devices - because it’s not about how powerful they are, it’s about how powerful they are _compared to the other miners_. 

I see how you’re trying to construct this system, so that collectively lots of people watching the same video will end up mining enough coin to be worth it together. So far, nobody has been able to figure out the economics of this well enough to make this actually work in practice. In the best case, a small amount of crypto would be mined for videos that go viral, most crypto goes to miners watching their own videos, and every other video would get zero crypto. 

This is why I said it’s well suited for malware. I’m not saying that your imagining malware, I’m just saying that it does actually generate money efficiently in a malware context. With malware, you’d gets lots of peoples devices all mining for you for long periods of time- and this would function similar to the “watching your own videos” scenario I described, which is how most coins would be mined. 

All that being said - it’s still a nice idea! It’s just that there are difficult problems that nobody has been able to solve yet that need to be solved for it to work.",1642111025.0,1

Because if so, then you seem to have missed the whole point of the verification aspect of the idea. Nobody would be able to repost content on the system or post copyrighted material they don’t own without it being treated the exact same way Youtube would treat it.

The verification would make it so that every file downloaded from a creator’s upload would need to be verified that it matches the original upload, or it won’t play. If someone tries to repost it on the system to monetize it themselves and cut out the creator… the system would detect that upload’s content as matching the content of the original upload, the same way Youtube’s algorithm detects and blocks copyrighted material. The same would go for posting copyrighted material that’s not on the system, where the owners of the copyright in question would have the same recourse they currently have with Youtube. Whatever the copyright laws in the country in question are, they would apply and be enforceable by the system’s algorithms.

I figured this all would have been clear when I said that the files need to be verified to work. It’s part of the reason I assume blockchain technology would work, because it’s all about transactions being approved by verification of authenticity in a decentralized peer-to-peer network.

I feel like you’re still kinda missing the point of the collective mining and the fact that the rewards go to the creator, not the people doing the mining. It doesn’t matter if a person with a cellphone doesn’t have enough power to ever get rewards… as long as they’re contributing even a tiny bit to the collective mining power, then that’s all that matters. To the creator, it doesn’t matter if the rewards are coming from a million people or 1 guy with a supercomputer… it’s all the same to the creator. The point of having a large pool of consumers viewing the content is to spread that around as much as possible, and wherever the balance falls in terms of who’s doing the most mining, then so be it. It’s not a competition between the miners like it is when they’re competing for the rewards, because they’re all just working together to reward the creator. I think that requires a fundamentally different way of thinking about it compared to normal crypto mining, and I’m not sure you or anyone else here is really grasping that aspect of it. If you’re saying that no current blockchain technology could work this way, then I guess I am actually suggesting an evolution of the technology that would require a whole new type of collective mining method to be developed. And yes, I realize that’s a big ask.


The issue of people just viewing their own content to reward themselves… again, so be it, if that happens. I don’t think that would prevent them from still contributing a substantial amount to other creators, because as much as I personally love watching my own content (I made it the way I like it, after all!)… I can’t spend ALL my time watching my own content. Sooner or later, I’m gonna wanna watch some other people’s shit. I’m gonna wanna throw on a movie or tv show or any of the type of content I’m interested in. Nobody would ever JUST watch their own content and NEVER anybody else’s. I mean, do current filmmakers who have movies on Netflix just stream their own shit all day long to rack up views on it so Netflix pays them more? Probably not. And even if they did, I don’t think that’s necessarily a problem at all. In the case of a blockchain, as long as they’re running the node, they would still be contributing to powering the blockchain with their mining, so even if they’re just watching their own content, they wouldn’t just be free-loading.

On the issue of inflation, I do see that being a potential problem, but not necessarily any more so than any cryptocurrency that isn’t hard-capped on supply like Bitcoin is (Ethereum or Doge, for instance). Maybe it could be hard-capped and still work somehow? But I figure not really, once all the coins are mined. Ideally, it wouldn’t be capped, so it can go on in perpetuity, and the creators with a vested interest in keeping the price up would keep re-investing some of their profits back into the system. And again, just imagine how much investment capital would be pumped into it if the likes of Hollywood et al got on board. I think that would overcome inflation for a pretty good while at least. I mean, for example, how long do we think Ethereum can stay valuable enough without a hard-cap to prevent inflation? For that matter, how long do we think fiat currency can remain valuable enough to keep the economy functioning with all this inflation going on? It’s a widespread problem, so again, if other systems that face these same problems have managed to work well enough for as long as they have and/or will… this system could too.

And finally, yes, I certainly understand this is all tough stuff to figure out and make work, but that’s why I came here to see what the actual obstacles are.

Antivir software: all antivit software has a fundamental flaw, it can only find already known malware, it is mathematical impossible to find out what a pice of code does(called the halting problem).

Walled garden: this defeats the whole idea of crypto and blockchain, if you have a central authority like apple(the classic example for a walled garden) they can just give out coins, you dont need to form consent between individuals anymore.

Another intuition for you: As a network gains miners, each miner has an incentive to grow larger, so they don’t become a smaller percentage of the whole.

This scales on and on, and is part of the reason you can’t make money on an iPhone mining Bitcoin.

https://hbr.org/amp/2020/05/building-a-transparent-supply-chain

Blockchain technology has a few beneficial characteristics that you mentioned: immutability, transparency, and decentralization. However, private rather than public blockchains can be designed in a centralized way that still utilizes the other benefits. This is what IBM, Walmart, and some other companies are doing for supply chain blockchain tech. Some highlights from the article:

“A blockchain is valuable partly because it comprises a chronological string of blocks integrating all three types of flows in the transaction and captures details that aren’t recorded in a financial-ledger system. Moreover, each block is encrypted and distributed to all participants, who maintain their own copies of the blockchain. Thanks to these features, the blockchain provides a complete, trustworthy, and tamperproof audit trail of the three categories of activities in the supply chain.”

“Blockchain thus greatly reduces, if not eliminates, the kind of execution, traceability, and coordination problems that we’ve discussed. Since participants have their own individual copies of the blockchain, each party can review the status of a transaction, identify errors, and hold counterparties responsible for their actions. No participant can overwrite past data because doing so would entail having to rewrite all subsequent blocks on all shared copies of the blockchain.”",1641953053.0,9

1. NFTs are tokens, not the art. You are not paying to obtaint the artefact, you are paying to be registered as the token-owner.

2. Blockchains have limited and costly storage, whereas artworks have presumably high definition preferences. So art is not stored on the chain. Instead, a pointer to a URL is stored. Presumably that contains the requisite art, but if the server goes down/stops serving it/serves something else then you won't find your chosen artwork there, you'll find a 404 or whatever.

3. Blockchains are deterministic - a block has to be verified, which means everyone verifying it has to reach the same conclusion about the resulting block.  In some chains (Blockchain, Ethereum) the entity mining a block is unknown, so you can have future information which isn't known until the block begins to be mined, but you can't insert randomness inside the block in any chain I've seen.

4. As blocks have to be verified, everyone can run the algorithm to work out what the block contains. So even if you did store the artefact on chain, everyone can check that the new version of the artefact is correct, so they can also generate it.

5. Blockchains solve one specific problem: that in a digital era where all information is easily perfectly copied, it is hard to construct a system that enforces scarcity. So NFTs are tokens which are constructed to be scarce, in as much as you need the owner's permission to modify the ledger entry. Trying to use this system to create a non-copyable or non-replicable artefact misses the point; artefacts are assumed to be replicated perfectly.

6. Suppose you wanted to create such a system to create a time-dependent artefact, e.g. it has the date in the corner which is updated every day, and you still want this on the chain because you want that time-dependence to be independent of any centralized image server. This would mean that at least one block of the chain every day has to include the regeneration of your image, and you would have to pay the gas fees for this regeneration, every time.

To be honest, this goes against the point of a distributed ledger - if you want to prove you're the current owner of the token, you point to the public ledger and let people check for themselves.

If you want to create an artefactory which combines your artefact with the date and your ownership proof, then that might be a fun service, but it's one that would exist parallel to the ledger, not on it or generated by it.",1641838598.0,1

My gut feeling is no, because blockchains in general and autonomous contract chains like Ethereum in particular act like one collectively-run, slow computer. So requiring that it does a computation so unreasonably hard that no one could get to the answer quicker seems not to fit.

It might be possible with a function as you describe, in that the verification doesn't have to be as slow, but you still require the computation to be performed by every mining node, and if the computation wasn't contained and continued in every block, then it could be outpaced. 

None of this improves the energy wastage argument against PoW chains.

Ultimately assuming that some function's eventual output can't be predicted by someone out there with a faster computer ignores the reality that there are some people out there with faster computers.

Fees have several purposes:

* pay miners (and proposers on the beacon chain)
* prevent loops and infinitely execution of pseudo-turing complete code
* Gas arbitrage

EIP-1559's purpose is to make fees more predictable, not necessarily to make it cheaper. And it also keeps the overall monetary inflation almost negligible. (Despite most people misunderstanding, its current circulating supply is less inflationary than Bitcoin's, but monetary inflation isn't necessarily bad in the first place.)

Without high fees, the network security degrades, and you can't expect it to hold on altruism alone.

Ethereum's ecosystem is sustainable indefinitely even with its proof of work consensus. Bitcoin and most blockchains are unsustainable with current transaction fees. When Bitcoin's block subsidy declines by 99% in 30 years, its transaction fees are probably going to go up 5-50x. Similarly, many blockchains subsidize their block rewards and staking for 5-10 years. Those blockchains will also need to transition to a different economic model once they approach their time bomb.

Ethereum is different in that it's already economically-sustainable and will get cheaper with rollups and data sharding.",1641914789.0,6

But the fact is that at the time EIP-1559 was introduced, the Ethereum network was ON FIRE about transaction costs and was so unreliable for regular users that it was a problem that needed to be fixed. Yes it's still expensive but at the time it was expensive AND unpredictable meaning you could pay $250 for a transaction and still have it not go through and lose the fee anyway because you didn't accurately predict the cost. I think they acted out of pressure and really pushed this protocol through out of needing to act. 

Prioritizing deflation through burning also gives a little head start to the idea of rewarding those with a bigger hold of ETH which was never really a thing before. The idea is that over a long enough time, the more ETH you hold the better off you'll be if it's deflationary and it's meant to reward those people, not average joe users. Again I'm not sure exactly why this was prioritized over sidechain development but here we are, it's just how the devs decided to go about it. I'm speculating but maybe they saw the rise of other L2s and sidechains and see that as a bandaid for the time being, allowing them to focus their energy on the PoS merge/difficulty bomb which seems to be their #1 priority at this point, and putting sharding on the backburner for now",1641911422.0,2

No. If the market decides that a unit of gas is worth 100 gwei, then it's worth 100 gwei at that specific point in time. The fact that ~90% gets burned doesn't mean that the fair market value is actually 10 gwei and everyone else is overpaying by 90 gwei. If you artificially reduce the basefee so that the cost is 10 gwei, then you'll just suffer the known consequences of price fixing. If anything the priority fee would then jump to 90 gwei and the miner would get it.

EIP1559 didn't change the market value of gas, it just overhauled the dynamic. Instead of miners getting that 100 gwei, the network gets it. It makes more sense this way, the network is offering blockspace, not the miners. The miners are basically ""employees"" providing security to the network and getting compensated for it with the reward of 2 ETH every block they mine.

Both of those make ether not the intended purpose which is to be the fee coin of ethereum.

In order for proof of stake to work, there must be some value accrued to the token on the base chain. By burning the base fee it's like a little dividend every block where ether gets more scarce the more it is used and creates a self balancing act based on supply and demand. (hell on Bitcoin it needs to accrue value as well or else there is no security budget .)

>staking costs nothing 

It makes your fund highly illiquid, requires nearly 100% uptime, all the bandwidth/storage costs of running a node, and gets you a much bigger exposure to the inherent risks of the network (can't pull out your money as easily if something goes wrong). This is a non-negligible cost, especially given the very high minimum amount of funds required to stake. 

>no reason to give any control 

what control?? There is no on-chain governance. You don't get to control much as a validator. It's not an active ""i have money therefore all the power to change the rules"" scheme, it's more of a passive ""i have money, i put it up as a stake to show i won't mess with anything so that I dont get it slashed"". The most you can do as a validator is censor transactions, and even then it's pretty rare for any given validator to get selected for a block proposal. With proposer/builder separation this control will be mitigated even more.

FALSE. 72m.

access to send coins to ""sale"" may have been permissionless but it was free for only 1 central party that at 0 cost and all profit could freely buy from their own sale and pick any % they keep. that's why 0 developers do ICO's and premines, just scammers. literally a central advantage of infinity

12m figure is pinky swear promise someone said that that's all they kept, when you have to trust 1 party with all of 72m and 0 way to check except trust. eth security is based on pinky promise that 1 central party refused free eth from ""sale"" of premine.

IRRELEVANT TINY COST. you can have just part of your funds stake, in fact pos lets you sell part of coins from reward while still being able to grow % control you have at same time. and the key here is unforgeable costs that automatically adjust to make sure costs are as large as rewards, not some miniscule costs of having uptime. that's nothing compared to billions of dollars in rewards and completely free 72 million eth premine just for 1 party.

\> what control??

making blocks, mev, censorship

and just like with any blockchain, incentives control blockchains so they get to change rules ona whim including who owns what allowing confiscations, dilutions, and so on like the imbeciles of ethereum foundation have already done

\>  it's pretty rare for any given validator to get selected for a block proposal

rare lol. with 72 mil free central eth split between easily sybil'able millions of nodes you can run you can ensure you'll be selected way more than any outsider. censoring users is literally what makes it a 100% permissioned system as we ALWAYS knew about pos and fact stake has owners.

That's why its so important PoW depends on an external resource like matter/energy that's permissionless and makes it unforgeably costly on top of that to take away all incentive to control and why PoS has always been just something that requires infinite illiteracy on this topic. PoS is ""secure"" in same way a database is secure, and that has nothing to do with permissionless protocols.

and there's also ability to selectively devalue incentives/incentives for particiapnts in any soft/hard forks of the blockchain via external markets that ethereum foundation has literally done before to control eth that remains in any consensus system [https://medium.com/@WhalePanda/ethereum-chain-of-liars-thieves-b04aaa0762cb#.66xdzc8nd](https://medium.com/@WhalePanda/ethereum-chain-of-liars-thieves-b04aaa0762cb#.66xdzc8nd)

Have fun proving all of basic math wrong as that's the premise that is needed to claim ethereum has ever been decentralized.

Giving yourself a dollar is free: -1 + 1 = 0

premine is a central point of control with 1 party having more control everyone else can have combined w/o central permission: 72m/supply > (supply - 72m)/supply

You can audit it yourself just fine. They can't magically print themselves more coins without breaking consensus rules, and they can't hide coins that haven't had an appropriate state transition. This is literally why all the initial transactions are all there in the genesis block: https://etherscan.io/block/0

>IRRELEVANT TINY COST

Exactly! Much tinier costs for the same economic security (if not more) as PoW. Win win for energy usage globally, and win win for the minimum viable issuance which is why it will drop drastically post-merge. But once the supply shock happens you will switch from calling the merge ""a false promise who will never happen, from devs who constantly never delivery"" (or whatever) to ""a coordinated gimmick with no other goal than to pump the price"". 

>making blocks, mev, censorship

Oh okay so exactly the same control miners have today then. Better make it so the control goes toward someone with an actual *stake* in the network, no? Rather than someone who just wastes energy to win a hash lottery and then sell the coins for a profit. Why let people extract value like that?

>with 72 mil free central eth split 

You're delusional. There's less than 9 million staked, and the staking cap will likely be around 30 million. The ethereum foundation does NOT own 72 million Ether. Your math is all fucked up lmao

Only BTC & ETH really pass the bar for credibly neutral decentralisation at present. They have hundred of thousands of nodes with a relatively low barrier to entry, and they have many software implementations from many disconnected teams.

The best use case is for resolving conflicts that usually need lots of human effort to prove legitimacy and data security in environments where multiple intentions collide. Simple examples:   
   
- `EWT`: which allows for distributing energy and having smart contracts decide how that energy is used in focus of fairness.  
- `robonomics`: allowing IoT devices to communicate without data-privacy being risked.

Everything about the current environment is .com era before the crash except one thing and that’s the fed. 

They are going to try to pull back and that could mean things get very ugly. Like very very ugly. But contrary to popular belief, the fed needs crypto and furthermore it needs the metaverse. It’s only going to be able to pull back so much on it’s balance sheet before it causes a complete collapse. It needs economic growth which it hasn’t had in 15 years to absorb it. The physical western world is tapped out of places to find growth. Asia is behind in development so they still have plenty but sentiment in the west will only allow them to take so much advantage of that. This means the only place to find real economic growth to absorb that balance sheet is the metaverse. A place where we can suddebly double our population as everyone gets at least one digital avatar and almost no one owns anything there yet. Plus it’s basically infinite so commerce can’t run far further than the physical world. 

There’s no way the fed hasn’t thought of thought of this so it’s highly unlikely that they crush everything so bad that everyone loses interest and shuffles away for multiple years.

What 5 projects’ MCs did is not giving you a full picture at all. Multi year bear cycle is simply a lot less likely at this point than at any other time before. Some bleeding with the hawkish fed until they turn around and admit no raising of the rates can take out the supply they printed in the past 2 years. Then you will see an influx into alternative assets. Not to mention all the billions in venture that just can’t be deployed solely on the private markets. The biggest funds have to transition into public market buying to acquire target ownership, no one is selling 15%+ of their network to a single investor targeting ownership anymore. They’re slowly realising it now that some founders started pushing against it.

Not to mention the more the fed screws up, the more political instability there is and crypto always thrives on political instability. Just look at the adoption rates and which geographies they’re growing the most. People already are feeling the inflation and how useless their governments are. The fed has no way out of this, they delay with narratives like “it’s transitory” or “we’ll taper and we’ll normalise the markets” while the truth is they lost their only lever against inflation in 2007 when they kicked off QE and never recovered the rates to the previous levels. At the same time ECB never really stopped doing QE. Monetary economics 101.

You’re also making a massive mistake not factoring intrinsic value from all the games and marketplaces that are launching this year and those that have launched so far. Axie alone has 2m active players. Nfts are literally flying every time eth dips for a reason. I bet you haven’t even checked the decentralised virtual lands and the average value per user compared to other open worlds. Trading at random is far from being the only entertainment in this industry anymore. Gaming, experiences and decentralised open worlds use cases are what propel escape velocity, not speculation and day trading. These create the need for more infrastructure, the need for using L1 assets and most importantly they create skilled jobs (even if it’s mostly in the shape of freelancers organised by daos).

Interest rates have to be raised to match inflation even if it happens slowly markets will be affected whether you think so or not. Monetary policy will have to be added next year to reduce money supply so the markets will he affected even more so they will either be volatile or not profitable.

At least one country is standing up to the banks and trying to change things, that's also worth something.

That means there is no regulation to protect you from rugpulls, but most importantly billionaires.

Why anyone would consider a market completely beholden to whom has the most money to throw at it would be a safe place for growth is beyond me.

Get rich quick schemes are also get poor quick schemes.

Before adopting bitcoin, USD was their currency. After the US foolishly printed trillions of dollars causing inflation to rise El Salvador knew they had to do something. They weren’t getting any of that relief money from America. So them printing all that money is going to be devastating for El Salvador, especially since they aren’t getting any of those bailouts.  They saw the rise of inflation coming.

Using a bridge obscures the fact that you are connecting to the Tor network, and is intended for people in countries where simply using Tor is a crime or would draw unwanted attention. Consider using Tails Linux whenever you want to hide your activity. It sends all traffic over the Tor network, has instructions for connecting via a bridge, and runs off a live boot USB drive so that no traces of anything are left on your computer. Because it runs off a USB drive you can also run it on someone else's computer, like at a PC cafe or library.

Also get your coins off the CEXs and into local wallets. Personally I would convert everything into Monero. You can send it anonymously to a Monero wallet, maybe from that wallet to a second Monero wallet just to really destroy any trail you might be leaving. Poof the money has vanished. And from there if you want to convert the Monero back into other coins use a non-KYC exchange like TradeOgre.

It looks to me like crypto is not your top concern - considering you don't yet have a meaningful amount of it yet. Sure, keep savings if you can and do find a way to keep is safely, but don't risk your life for it. 

Btw, it goes to show how different ""life changing money"" can be for different people....

I came here to tell you to have hope. Things will get better and it might happen sooner than you think. I was born in Poland in the 80s, which means that I spent the first decade of my life living under a military dictatorship. There literally were tanks on the streets of Polish cities on the night of my birth. And it was supposed to last forever, with our Big Brother neighbor, The Soviet Union, keeping a firm grip on things.... And yet, 10 years later, it was all finished. The whole thing collapsed without a shot fired. 

In the meantime try to make the best of what you have. My best advice for you would be to learn. Learn foreign languages (you already speak English, which is something to be proud of and a massive asset to you), learn to code, learn to cook, learn to swim and dive, learn to play an instrument... anything and everything can be useful and this knowledge and skills is something no military dictatorship can take away from you. And it will benefit you greatly, when things in your country improve.

I've been to Myanmar, it's a fantastic country, rich in history, culture and natural beauty...and full of some of the kindest people I've met on my travels. And when it reopens again, tourists and investment will flow back in, bringing with it more wealth for you and your people.

Not sure if they would ban you, but many CEX for example have introduced KYC to comply with laws from various countries. So they could decide to comply with laws from your country.

The VPN ban will probably only be used on high profile people like journalists, it is impossible to go and catch thousands of VPN users. So best if you use an unpopular VPN to not get blacklisted.

Same for crypto, it will only be cracked down on they think you are funding anti-gov activity. Keep your private keys safely in a closet or whatever is best.

Crypto wallets are anonymous and dictators can't prove you own crypto.

Best of luck, I hope the military junta topples soon!",1642949299.0,3

Idk how hard they are going to actually search for you, but if they put in effort they can get around your vpn. Getting something like tor browser could help.

Didn’t really understand what he said, he was much smarter than me in that stuff, but you could probably find some stuff online. End of the day I know the us government at least can get to you if they really try hard enough pretty much no matter what you do, it’s just about making it so much work for them it’s not worth their time.

If I were you I would also get a software wallet. There is no way they are going to be able to get your money out of it unless they have the login, so worst case buy stuff you are down to hold for like 5 years or whatever and flee when you get out, but obviously that’s not ideal.

One thing you could do is get a new phone, use fake info and do not connect it to your name, buy with cash. Now the tricky thing is this phone can never be on when your real phone is on, and you should only use it in public wifi. You should also leave your real phone at home when you go out with your burner so as not to be triangulated with cell towers. There is a way to install a private phone OS I think Google has one, you can look into it but I am not an expert there. It could help though. Now you should have no trouble using a VPN privately. Your goal should be to put a layer between you and them. Also choose a reputable vpn and pay for it. My recommendation would be proton VPN due to the fact that I doubt Sweden would comply with Myanmar police requests but please do a bit of research there as well.

option 4: similar to option 3, but store that zipped txt file with your seed phrase in a random cloud storage account like drop box or something, create a new email address just for that, all you have to remember is your email, your password and password to the zip file, much easier to remember than memorising the seed phrase.

option 5: save your seed phrase on an SD card and stick it up your butt,

The second group of people to reach a new space are grifters. Grifters are not untalented: their skill is being able to sniff out where there's a gap between how much people want to be involved in something and how much they know about it. Look at the 90s and the Internet and you find just as many things that are similar. Look at oil and railroads in the 1800s even, and you can find plenty of bullshit startups fleecing people promising to go build railroads and find oil. Does that mean railroads and oil were flashes in the pan? No.

Also, not all of the trash is grifting. Some of it is just wild mediocrity. A lot of losers who would never get their ideas funded in a bear market just get the money hose pointed at them during bubbles, even if they absolutely lack the talent to back it up. Again, look at the 90s: most of the really dumb websites weren't scams, they were just bad ideas that didn't deserve money but got it anyway.

This has to happen, there's no way around it, the public hates everything when it's new. The public hated rock and roll (and at the same time, when rock and roll started you know the record companies sent out 10,000 shitty Elvis imitators before they started to figure it out - and think of how many beatles imitators there were, and how many nirvana imitators. any new success brings bad imitations in its wake) they hated computers they hated the internet.

NFT = Non Fungible Tokens. And they're just a number represented by an image, sound, gif - but here's what most people don't know.

If you buy an NFT, you're essentially just buying a Queue number, you don't own the artwork, in fact - a lot of NFT's have stolen art associated with it, you think you got the rights to the artwork or the use of that artwork, NOPE you don't. You're still just buying a queue (a number) that is associated with whatever art piece, film snub, still-image that it was associated with, you own the number and that particular place in the Queue - Nothing else.

You don't even have the rights to the artwork, game or whatever, you can't even use it legally in any way. You have just purchased the rights to a place in the queue, and that particular club you're a member of - which that queue is in, the artwork...not so much.

Maybe the scammers and thieves are different here but how is Rivian or so many other ""unicorns"" really different from dog coins?  They don't have shit for any real world product yet and were pumped like crazy.

This is just the way financial markets are sadly, at least in crypto you have a chance with DOT to get in pre ICO, or AVAX with pre litigation offerings (PLO) and many other options.

Also we need to stop shitting on VC so hard, yeah they suck sometimes but fucking hell who else is gonna put up millions of dollars in a tech company that is just an idea when they begin investing, they probably lose a ton of money on most deals so they have to bank on the ones that hit so they can keep going.  Again, I think DOT helps fix this somewhat but you still need to get the project off the ground, ACALA, GLMR you name it all had to get VC money to get started.

The entire country has been usurped by fur trappers, whalers, prospectors, tobacco farmers, etc. In the eye of respectable Europeans, all of these bring zero legitimacy to the country. A long depression is good for weeding out all this nonsense.

&#x200B;

We just saw a cycle where useless beaver furs ran up to 50 billion market cap and more. People were selling millions of dollars for whaling contracts giving them claim on future whaling expeditions. People are buying the rights to land to plant tobacco where there is now endless forest. What even in this country? It's economy puts every other bubble in history of mankind to shame.

&#x200B;

If you wonder why the Europeans hate Americans viciously, this is why. It’s not an isolated incident or two, but a culmination of multiple events that are textbook examples of the worst capitalism has to offer.

&#x200B;

The entire country has become a circus of greed, scams, zero sum offerings where one is looking to profit from another. If you go to other reddit subs like r/feudalism, they are all spot on about America, the whole country is one big clown world detached from fundamentals.

&#x200B;

You dont even need to bring tobacco farmers into this, even without them is a country aggregating the worsts of the worst. You have exchanges and other large players legitimatizing ponzi whaling expeditions by giving them attention and even running contracts on their money competitors. You have banks expedition stocks as collateral. Guess what happens to that $100k loan that was taken out using expedition as collateral, when their ships run into a storm and never return? A culmination of all of these is cascading liquidations and steep corrections.

&#x200B;

If you really believe in the economy and future of America, you have every reason to be angry about what the country has turned into. It has been one relentless machine churning out scam after scam.

&#x200B;

A depression offers actual builders to work in peace building good products that Europe needs, while removing all the baggage that comes with increasing prices and the vicious cycle of people looking to profit from one another, and heightened regulatory attention that grifters and scams bring to America as a whole.

&#x200B;

America has a lot to offer the world, but only if the right products are built offering value to Europeans. A ponzi economy aint it, champ.

A lot of the ""value"" from NFTs are not simply from the ""artwork"" which you may or may not own, but because of the cryptographic proof that you ""have"" a place in queue or club (DAO). That is, immutable and permanent proof on a blockchain that you do hold and control a particular NFT.

Such proofs are used for things such as exclusive entry to purchasing events, whitelists or even benefits like reduced or no fees on certain platforms (exchanges or swap platforms). They are also used in real life to verify entry to certain events (RCRDSHP NFTs/Cards are used as entry tickets to music events, Bored Ape Yacht Club let's you get on celebrity yacht parties etc) and the more popular NFT's are used as airdrop targets for other projects as they know the owners are ""wealthy"".

1. Failed Tx don't cost anything provided your dapp is doing things properly (simming Tx prior to submission) and if they fail they don't enter a block.

2. Some of the failures weren't Tx failures but slippage invalidations (price moved out of slippage window set by user and therefore scoopers must cancel the order).

3. Wallets using Blockfrost as a backend had significantly worse rates of failed Tx. This was caused by Blockfrost's nodes being too geographically centralised and there being too few nodes on their backend. If you used flint, yoroi, or any other non-Blockfrost wallet, your Tx were far more likely to get included. Nami (the main Blockfrost wallet) now supports routing Tx to a node of your choosing (Tx submit is a REST API). If you are running into issues, try spinning up a local full node and route Tx through that.",1642947901.0,54

I'm happy that the cardano foundation will turn a few parameters, lowering the bar of entry for the projects but we should support the projects who take the same theoretical approach in praxis, just like the project they build on does.

Eth isn't ready yet. It's bogged by congestion, just in a different way  
DOT is is barely functional

Yea sundae is shit right now and cardano is already overloaded by the NFT space. Stacking DeFi on that was obviously going to fuck shit right up.

It uses third-party servers that can re-order, drop, or fail to fill user-submitted orders if the software was modified to do so. None of this is made clear to investors who still believe this is a dApp contained exclusively on the blockchain itself.

Next, where is the source code to the Plutus smart contract component of this dApp? I can show you the source for Uniswap, Tinyman, and a million other dApps right now.

Crypto markets are very immature, which means they can easily be swayed by hype or what is trendy, i.e., Doge, Shib, and, yes, even Cardano for a little while there. However, it's not apt in any way to lump Doge and Shib in with Cardano on this comparison for a few reasons.

First, there is a plan for Cardano's development. There always has been and it is being executed step-by-step. Yes, it's taking longer than expected, but welcome to crypto. How far behind is Ethereum in its stated roadmap for the rollout of proof-of-stake? ...data sharding? ...don't even get me started on computational sharding, which appears to have been abandoned all together.

Next, look at Cardano's growth and market cap over the past 4 years. It has **consistently** remained in the top 15 throughout that entire time. It's proving that it can stand the test of time. It's actually not too different from Doge in that respect...Doge just keep popping up every time we hit peak bull market. Biggest difference there is that while Doge shows pump and dump types of behavior, Cardano sees more of a peaks and valleys type of behavior.

Just like everything else about Cardano's design, there exists a balance. They have thought the whole thing through and decided where they would make tradeoffs and compromises to build a blockchain that would work for the majority of people that would need to use it. That includes a balance between its technology AND its marketing. The time was taken to peer review and formally verify. The benefits of those decisions is that they've built a ledger that can easily be sharded, is significantly decentralized, and will belong to the people, not big money interests. All of that massive plan (and, yes...there is a plan, which has repeatedly been delivered on albeit with some delays along the way, as discussed) takes time. In the meantime, it's been hyped. It's a balance...and it needs both of those things to survive in the long term.",1642963674.0,1

In the end we will just have to wait and see. All cryptos are in development and we will see who is first to be able to solve the blockchain trilemma.

I'm skeptical of cardanos road map and peer reviewed research.

A big selling point a cardano is low flat rate fees but I never understood how that would be sustainable under heavy network demand with limited TPS. With defi coming I would have thought cardano would have released a fee market or some sort of queue system. Only now conversations are starting to resolve this.

Why must smart contracts be included in each TX. I know this will be fixed with an update soon but why design this way in the first place knowing each tx consumes a huge chunk of the block.

There is an issue of concurrency with eutxo and it seems like everyone is just trying to downplay it. We've seen with sundaeswaps scooper solution it's extremely slow and you also have to rely on trusted 3rd parties. I have yet to see a decent solution.",1642977108.0,1

The tribalism is going way too far. I have my projects that I like, primarily Cardano, but it's by no means the only project I'm interested and there will definitely be multiple chains that are all good at their specific thing.

I think the perspective to keep in mind is that the Cardano ecosystem was kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place when it came to the smart contract system, at least through the lens of how it is being perceived. Before smart contracts, the narrative was, ""no smart contracts."" After smart contracts, the narrative was, ""where are the dapps? Nobody is building!"". After the dapps, the narrative is now becoming, ""Cardano wasn't ready!""

So, it's kind of like damned if you do, damned if you don't. IOG and Sundae were definitely collaborating and came to a strategic decision. Really, the choice was, which pieces of FUD are we more OK with existing...no smart contracts, nobody is building, or Cardano wasn't ready? I'm personally quite happy that Sundae was released just so everybody can start moving on to their new piece of FUD.

Cardano definitely has it's shortcomings, you have stated several valid ones in your comment. The one I don't agree with is the concurrency. EUTxO is actually built to be massively concurrent since it can more easily be sharded at the ledger level. And, since smart contracts are ""attached"" to the UTxO and only validated on-chain, data and computational sharding are going to be a breeze on Cardano. It just needs a little time to mature first. I think that if you compare it to Ethereum when that ecosystem was at a similar phase in their growth, Cardano outperforms it. Yes, time will tell!",1642978720.0,1

The exchange is decentralized because users interact with smart contracts that are ran on the Blockchain instead of a centralized server. The transaction is peer-to-peer and doesn't require a third party to exchange the tokens. How the UI is hosted is entirely irrelevant.

*I see you added a note about listing tokens in their UI - I agree there's a certain level of censorship being applied there for better or worse (Cardano tokens are registered in a [similar](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry) way to prevent scams and proof tokenomics). Judging by their contract code, this limitation is only applied to their UI - you could potentially list an unregistered token directly to the smart contract, but someone would need to do the same for the order to fill. You can see the contract executing [here](https://cardanoscan.io/address/addr1wy2mjh76em44qurn5x73nzqrxua7ataasftql0u2h6g88lc3gtgpz), and read the code [here](https://github.com/MuesliSwapTeam/muesliswap-cardano-contracts/blob/main/order-validator/src/Cardano/MuesliSwapOrderValidator/OrderValidator.hs).

Legislation likely wont do all that much as it prob wont change much from how crypto is taxed in the usa. Xrp court case may just provide temporary pop but could also be a sell the news event at this point the longer it gets dragged. Well see how this year shapes up.

There are a lot of coins that have great potential and in those cases, yeah, I’d say HODL if you’re confident in that project.

In other cases with some subpar coins or projects you’re not too keen on but that there’s hype and current positive sentiment on, then snapping 5-20% profits is probably a good bet - but this is very dangerous because day trading is a sure way to fuck yourself.

AMP is a proprietary walled garden which [benefits Google](https://www.socpub.com/articles/chris-graham-why-google-amp-threat-open-web-15847) and [hurts everyone else](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/19/open_source_insider_google_amp_bad_bad_bad).

It is bad for publishers because it forces them to duplicate development effort, and prevents differentiation and customisation. It also allows Google to watch you even after you've left their search results page.

These are US based publications, attacking a foreign leader that they are very displeased with. I mean, is it not strange that this particular president is being attacked more so than any other? Prior to the adoption of Bitcoin, nobody gave two shits about El Salvador. Now it has become the talk of the town. 

If you look into the history of the US and the things it has done to politically sabotage other nations, you might start to question the motives behind stories like these. The documentarian, Adam Curtis, does an excellent job of exposing the unsavory history of both the US and the UK. I recommend watching his material, of which there is plenty. Most of it can be found on YouTube. 

There is a lot of unsavory stuff happening all over the world. But the only events the news seems to consistently harp on are the events occurring in the nations that seem to have made an enemy of the US. Coincidence? No. It is called propaganda. Look into the work of Edward Bernays, the US’ former favorite propagandist. 

Bukele may be a dictator. He may even be using the people of El Salvador to enrich himself. But it is no different anywhere else. Even in the US, politicians and corporations continually use taxpayers to enrich themselves. Meanwhile, there are a record number of citizens sleeping in tents on the street. Right now, there are approximately 50 million Americans living in poverty. That is slightly more than 1/6 of the population. In other words, the US is El Salvador with a bigger budget. If this were not true, and the US was a shining beacon of success and anti-corruption, then no US citizen would feel the need to own crypto or to believe in its purpose. 

The bottom line here is this: If you are not part of the upper tiers of society, then you are getting fucked over and nobody at the top cares. The only thing that matters to them is extracting as much money from you as they can without ruining their chances of re-election and/or starting a revolt. 

The world is a cesspool, plain and simple. It is run by the worst types of people that you can imagine.

To clarify, this is a separate matter from the Gini coefficient and poverty rate that are not correct in what you have written. A gini of 0.47 would be amazing. El Salvador has a gini coefficient around 38.8 - a marked improvement since previous decades.

Why dont you ask the same thing to the New Congress? When the New Ideas congressmen interrogated Tony Saca, they never asked about that money. In fact, they called him ""President"", and never asked him to give those 300 million back. Why are you not telling that?

Oh, and might as well ask Nayib Bukele about it. Current Attorney General of El Salvador was a high ranking official during the Tony Saca Administration. Funny how you fail to mention that.

Never look at it like, for example 'i earned 10 dollars in passive income today'.

If the coin moons you risk only focusing on how much per day you are now suddenly making, which can make you fail to realise you've been earning that retrospectively too, so you should probably take some profit to cash that previous income, and sacrifice what you perceive to be an ongoing income.

1) SEC settle with Ripple, declare XRP deemed not a security today and going forwards, ripple pay a fine for sales when it would be deemed an investment contract. This gives SEC their “win” yet makes settlement terms acceptable for ripple. This leaves the SEC open to chase any other crypto they want as there is no case president of ripple winning what others can use to stop the sec sueing them. Meanwhile XRP is the only crypto given full legal clarity and the SEC is forced to go after ETH because of the corruption exposed in XRP case and the SEC want to save face.

2) ripple win on summary judgement, SEC rekt, XRP deemed not a security, case precedent set and SEC find it hard to sue any other crypto projects

3) SEC somehow win (despite that being lawfully impossible at this point, but let’s say we get a corrupt judge), XRP deemed a security and is illegal to trade in USA unless you’re a multimillionaire with accredited investor status. SEC go after ETH foundation and concensys next to save face after all what has been exposed, for a much easier win than they had with ripple.

We’re still yet to see a massive liquidation event and we’ll see this either sooner or later. This event will be the deepest point if it happens in this or next month.

The dollar seems to be raising in value aswell. This is pushing the downtrend even further. Besides that, the FED announced increased intrest rates. I think Warren Buffet once said that rising interest weights is like gravity to the stock market. Bitcoin and the stockmarket are pretty similar and both will go down if interest rates go up. Dont worry though, the dollar is broken and with the rise of interest rates Im very curious about what will happen to the dollar in the future. They cant afford to rise interest rates anyway

Oh and on top of that, the second half of 2021 we didnt see a lot of NEW crypto market participants flocking in. Most new investors came in at the end of 2020/start of 2021. After the may crash most people just started rebuying their positions after selling.

I used to believe in crypto as an alternative, then it started becoming a cult and the last couple years in particular have been really disappointing because all I see is just a breeding ground for further speculation and unfettered anarcho-capitalism.
Unregulated markets is where whales and corporations thrive. It's their game.
Maybe at the beginning of crypto it felt like this was the chance for the small people, because big players didn't know the rules yet. But now they do and they have much deeper pockets to influence mining, move huge quantities.

That's literally reasoning, not manipulation. 

You'll just like the word 'manipulation' in place of 'complex process of correlations and risk adjustment by large holders leading to markets moving'. The stock correlation is established. The fed correlation is established. Both are predictable. Crypto is a risk-on asset and gets sold first during turbulent times to move into risk-off assets. That's not manipulation, it's literally something you can see coming and is reasonably predictable. 

Manipulation would be saying your trillion dollar company will accept bitcoin and then doing a 360 and starting to hate on bitcoin. Also, connections with BlackRock/ Ark Invest and decision making in the shadows.

Yes sure it’s a good project, but I’m a little bit afraid of the hype and everything around it.
If there is so much hype and long power from the holders, normally it’s not going instantly up because of the big whales. They don’t want that we win money here. 
So I think it should take more time for lrc to get up instead of other coins. They just want that every holder gets out and they can buy a lot coins for a long time. Then they will start the run and we as normal people will see it when it’s already pumpin…
Just my thinking about lrc, no fud :)

6608,algotrading,Question about high frequency trading,420stonk69,1642920650.0,48,44,0.86,"There are a few things to consider. If you have a margin account (regardless of whether you’re trading *on margin*) you have access to sales proceeds immediately and can trade with unsettled funds. Settlement delays will only matter when it comes to cashing out. However, you’ll be subject to “pattern day trader” limitations if you have less than a $25k portfolio, meaning you’ll be limited to only a few day trades per week. If you have a $25k portfolio in a margin account, however, there is no restriction on day trades.

In a *cash* account on the other hand, you can make any number of day trades but you can’t trade with unsettled funds, no matter the portfolio size.  Doing so is called “free-riding”. If you are primarily day trading one security then pattern day trading and free-riding will probably be dealbreakers unless you put $25k in or don’t day trade until you hit $25k.

Once you do “unlock” daytrading, there’s still a limit of 390 orders per day on average, after which you’ll be reclassified as a professional trader and additional fees may be applied by your broker.

Good luck! Make sure to post after you try it out live! There’s no simulation as accurate as just letting it rip and see how it does in the real market.

Edit: Re-reading your post I see you said average 73 orders per day. So you’ll need a margin account (again, you’re under no obligation actually take out margin *loans*) and $25k in cash or stocks.",1642975092.0,2

&#x200B;

I started as an Index Manager at a mid sized ETF shop 8 months ago. Since my background is in software engineering, I've developed an interesting pipeline for automating the construction and rebalancing of my indices. I use Bloomberg for all of my data, but I also use a proprietary screening model to select constituents. What I have pictured above is the Bloomberg Terminal running in an AWS Workspace in which I also have configured to run CRON-type scheduled jobs. I'm using the local Bloomberg API (for those that don't know, when the terminal is running it starts an api service on a local port) which I then expose to a script running in Github Actions. The script in actions connects to the service running in the AWS workspace, pulls the security universe, and then applies the scoring/screening model. When the selection process is complete, they are automatically send to the index engineer and implemented in the ETFs  


Getting back to my post, running the terminal in the AWS workspace has the fortunate side effect of me being able to access it on my MacBook after hours. It runs surprisingly well with low latency in the workspace, highly recommend.

My method is the only true way... being a Python developer myself, and using common sense, I poked around BQNT and found out it creates a sandboxed Juypter notebook on your machine.. so you just need to copy the dependencies...

1. You need blpapi installed...
2. copy these files from c:/blp/bqnt/environments/bqnt-2/Lib/site-packages/
3. bqapi
4. bqbreg
5. bql
6. bqlmetadata
7. bqrequest
8. bqutil
9. ciso8601
10. blpapi

Copy all those files from the Bloomberg directory to your python directory  Lib/site-packages... if you're using a venv, then put them in /env/lib/site-packages

Open vscode and import bql and start the service with bql.Service()

&#x200B;

if you are using a Mac like me, then do all this stuff on the windows side in Parallels, then run cmd  and type jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8889 to start the Jupiter server and open vs code on Mac and connect to the VM IP and port. You can get the ip by typing ipconfig in windows terminal windowsIP:8889 At the bottom of vscode in a Jupyter notebook at the bottom left, it'll say connected locally, change that to remote and enter the IP and port of the VM... you can now run BQL like me.",1642973447.0,1

It doesn't need to be high-end (using a 1050, for example, would still be much faster than a CPU), the data you're training on and the size of your model is the biggest factor, because it determines how much memory you need.

Edit: To clarify, it's possible to train on CPU, but if you're working on the model, you're going to go through a lot of training, (using different model graphs, data preprocessing, etc...), so it's very time consuming. You train a lot because each time you want to try any changes or improvement to the model, you go through more training. If you got lucky and built a perfect model on the first try, you would only need to train once, but you wouldn't know it was the best model unless you trained some other ones that weren't as good, to prove your first model was the best.

The difference between CPU / GPU is about an hour of CPU training for every 5 minutes on a GPU.

7066,altcoin,Jacy looking juicy!,Monster1487,1642564131.0,50,22,0.74,"Thought I would take a stroll down shitcoin alley, its been a while.

I see nothing has changed, one webpage wonder that wont actually do anything useful until phase 4 ? and when is phase 4 ? I mean let's not confuse phases with quarters or was that the intention ? and if you keep going you can always kick that down the road, cant you ? Seen that tons of time and some app that has your webpage and ability to buy and see your balance is not an app. Where it the mock up of that ?

All this work, marketing, signing people up just for an NFT museum ?, in the scheme of things how hard is it to have built an NFT marketplace or have some kind of working model or part of one ?  and hey, I see you pumped and dumped once and its building back up or was that part of build up again ? Anyone who is passionate about something like this would have more than words.

and your contract ? it stunk before I gave it the smell test, better fixit up a little before certik looks at it: [https://tokensniffer.com/token/0x916c5de09cf63f6602d1e1793fb41f6437814a62](https://tokensniffer.com/token/0x916c5de09cf63f6602d1e1793fb41f6437814a62)

The interesting thing is that the new contracts stinks more then the old one:

0x08f2991a6eff2671cf791b82aeae64fbbfdd0633

[https://tokensniffer.com/token/0x08f2991a6eff2671cf791b82aeae64fbbfdd0633](https://tokensniffer.com/token/0x08f2991a6eff2671cf791b82aeae64fbbfdd0633)

I heard that the original pump and dump was caused by rogue developers and now its been taken over, new devs, new contract, new coin etc. Cool Story bro..... no one is doxed so how would anyone know ? Nice reset story, do a  pump and dump then roll out the script, new contract and start over with a nice slow dive this time. 

The interesting thing is that the new contract is full of more rugpull holes then the old one,

So if you fix up the rugpull holes, Certik only audits the security and some possible code flaws but they dont verify what the program does, if its useful, if it actual does something. They passed a shit coin that was the equivalent of a metal cash box with a padlock on it.

Does anyone know what a white paper is anymore ? this has some vague pie in the sky ideas.

Your tokennomics is boilerplate from all the other shitcoins with reflections.

Where is your team doxed ? how about names and linkedin profiles on the webpage ? What have they got to hide ?

Listing on CMC or coingeko means nothing, its no endorsement of anything, tons of shitcoins are listed.

But hey, dont worry, I have written emails like this before because I cared about people new to crypto getting ripped off. But I guess its greed that gets the better of them once they drank the kool-aid.

I would be careful in your response,  I may never come back unless provoked. I poked my head in another shitcoin back in february that managed to kick the can down the road 10 months and it still does nothing and people still believe. But because they jumped all over me, I made it a point of coming back once a month, today is that day, Shall I add you to the list ?",1642619544.0,3
