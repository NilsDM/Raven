>The set of shards can be arbitrarily sized, enabling massive parallelization of the consensus process. Notably, this form of parallelization introduces a tunable tradeoff between security and scalability: reducing the number of shards each node covers increases parallelism and scale, but decreases the validator set size of a given shard. This capability allows the system designer to select a minimum threshold of per-shard node coverage that achieves high practical security, while maximizing parallelism and scale by allowing a large number of independent nodes. This is unique to Cerberus and discussed further in the analysis section.

So they can *kinda* place the tradeoff however they want with the way their sharding design works.  But the way they frame it here is the misleading part, and where it reveals that Radix doesn't really solve any new problems because they don't do anything to decrease the overall load of fully verifying the ledger, so sacrificing decentralization as the network utilization increases and compromising its resistance to validator corruption by forcing reliance on third parties.",1642614801.0,1

is people spending large quantities of money* for tokens which represent an image and do little else, a trend which will die out shortly? Hopefully.   

I don't see what problem you think NFTs for music is supposed to solve? You talk about removing middlemen, but NFTs don't seem to provide anything for that that just, letting people buy the song online using a cryptocurrency, doesn't already provide.  

If you think that they could help with DRM for audio in a way that isn't feasible for DRM for images on account of images being screenshot-able, you should know that the same can be done with audio (might be slightly more difficult, but cannot be really protected against.).  

(Also, DRM on music is against freedom)  

I of course agree that being able to more easily create/handle tokens that represent individual intangible things can be useful.

edit: also, if scalability issues are solved (or possibly using a permissioned chain with a large number of known entities, who could be held accountable for any behavior contrary to what the protocol dictates?) then the idea (which some are already pursuing) of using tokens to track what resources went into making products, in order to be assured about where the materials came from, and where the labor and other steps were done, when a manufacturing process involves materials being bought and sold between many companies. Like e.g. where did the oil come from to make this plastic? where was the plastic made? where was the plastic made into parts of shoes? The shoe company presumably doesn't process the oil into plastic themselves, nor the other materials.
Of course, these assurances would only be as trustworthy as those who made them, at least this would make it so they can be tracked. Like, if you are making a cake to sell, you can't generate yourself the assurance that the eggs were from a farm with humanely raised chickens without inventing a made-up farm entity to sign those, which people wouldn't recognize as an existing farm. An actual farm might claim to raise their chickens humanely but not actually do so, and this wouldn't solve that problem, but there are other solutions for that part. This still helps avoid the issue of the cake-maker making up the info about the source of the eggs though. (Because, the problem of checking if a farm exists is even more solved than checking if the farm raises their chickens humanely.)  

(to be clear, I'm not like, especially interested myself in animal welfare stuff, just describing it as a use.
Another use could be getting certifications that various steps in the process didn't emit large amounts of CO2, or something. Would need certification organizations for that, but still.)",1642553882.0,5

 Also more users might/might not decrease the gas fee as this would lead to congestion and hence higher the gas fee faster will your nft be minted.

51,CryptoTechnology,Are NFTs really meant to be a quick and ephemeral trend?,Accomplished_Mess116,1642531885.0,94,59,0.87,"I think as of now we’re in the alpha stage of NFTs, just to see what they can do, if they’re viable, or if they need to be pivoted to other use cases.

The main way that I have thought about NFTs being useful would be in a subscription/membership based model. Like for example if an exclusive restaurant issued X amount of NFTs that indicated that you held a reoccurring reservation, or just that you were allowed to eat at that particular restaurant. This NFT now not only holds value for the owner of it, but also for the restaurant.

The restaurant would gain an initial investment, and the customer now has an asset that will hopefully appreciate if the restaurant does well. Now if it does appreciate, then the customer could sell the NFT for a profit, the restaurant could then make X percentage on the resale, and would now have record of who the person sold to. This would obviously be a permission based blockchain.

I think that NFTs in particular could be useful for something like this because if it’s a smaller, permission blockchain then it would be easier to track sale and re-sale history. It would also just streamline some processes (re-sale, commission collection, knowing who holds what NFT) that could otherwise be a nuisance, or simply not cost efficient. They could also have an NFT verification system at the restaurant to prevent any forgery. There are definitely other ways to do this outside of just NFTs but this has been the primary way that I see NFTs actually having utility.

If anyone disagrees then please let me know because I would love to hear what other people think but this is just the idea that I’ve played around with.",1642602184.0,1

Ethereum is like a general purpose decentralised computer where you have a lot of freedom with what you can build on top of it and pay for computation time whether it succeeds or not. Tokens and non-fungible tokens are simply a code standard.

Algorand utilize the account model like Ether. The account model works by removing tokens from one account and adding it to another account in a transaction causing the state of all involved accounts to be a part of the transaction. Instead of being general purpose, it is developed for financial assets and has native support for it. This simplifies some things like asset transfers, has some benefits like fixed cost, and comes with a lot of features and configurability for assets making it suitable for regulated assets.

Cardano use an UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output) model, similar to Bitcoin, instead of an account model. To send a transaction you spend tokens as inputs and create new UTxOs. One address can have several UTxOs so instead of a global state of accounts you have to validate for a transaction, you simply spend a token as an input and create a UTxO belonging to a different address. Cardano doesn't offer feature rich assets like Algorand or decentralised computing like Ethereum but you can accomplish some of the same things by making a Script/UTxO that holds an NFT or Token instead of an account holding it directly.

*"" Are there any safeguards to ensure that L2 doesn't act maliciously?""*

There are two levels of safeguards. The first is in L2 itself, depending on the L2 technology itself and how it's configured, there are generally rules about what you can and can't do and you will be punished if you do not follow them. This ""punishment"" step is often handled by the L1, and this is the second layer of safeguard. For example, if you are transferring coins through some lightning nodes and one lightning node doesn't transfer the coins as promise, a lightning node can take that info to the L1 chain and say ""hey, look, they promised they'd transfer the coins and they didn't!"" and L1 chain will force the transfer or revert the transfer or whatever the rules require. In short, L2 provides transaction capacity while relying on L1 only for enforcing rules when something goes wrong.

For optimistic rollups, the safeguard is that participants who verify the transactions and submit fraud proofs in case of any fraudulent activity.

For ZK rollups, the layer 1 smart contract verifies that the zero knowledge proofs submitted by the layer 2 operators are valid.

\>  What if an L2 operator pushes an update that sends 10% of every transaction to their own wallet

Transactions have to be signed by the sender, otherwise they are invalid. For zk rollups, this means that an operator trying to insert fraudulent transactions will submit an invalid zero knowledge proof that will be rejected by the layer 1 smart contract. For optimistic rollups, this means that a participant who detects the fraud can submit a fraud proof and be rewarded for it while the malicious operator is penalized.

Opening up new revenue streams via resale commission. But the offering for buyers/collectors hasn’t been particularly great. I personally am not interested in the whole “buy to get access to our private discord” - and it looks like being part of an exclusive online club doesn’t seem to be enough now. The issues with theft and rip offs are a real bummer but this happens today in the art world. It’s just that with the blockchain everyone can see how much was stolen and what was used to rip people off. 

The more interesting applications do intrigue me though, as NFTs are proof of ownership having utility in the real world could add real value. Redeemable events, conferences and concerts, access to restaurants and physical goods all exist in the NFT world today. I’m curious how this will pan out. 

In video games the idea of NFTs gets met with a huge amount of hate - not just dismissal. Sure companies need to buy in and invest time to use the blockchain data in their products. But let’s not use the argument of “buy x here use it there”.  Today if you purchase a digital good today it’s account bound. You can sell your account but that’s against TOS in most cases and it’s an all or nothing affair. The company owns your account and can revoke access at any time. Some companies allow you to resell digital goods, but only through their storefront and limited to other users who don’t already have the item. Blockchain would allow you to send, sell or burn on any store that uses that blockchain (or send off chain). If your account gets banned or stolen, your purchases are in your wallet and you can take them with you. Again, it’s the ownership that’s important not the uniqueness in this scenario. 

Then there’s interesting applications in the digital publisher world. If you purchased game licenses as NFTs and could use them at any digital store, and buy or resell through them. The store takes a cut to make some money, the publishers get commission and you actually own the game license. But that’s all pipe dream stuff and not likely. An interesting thought experiment. 

Something to remember when people call NFTs worthless is that they are literally tokens similar to any other crypto based token. The main different with ERC-20 and ERC-721 is that ERC-721 has a unique id and metadata. It’s just that 1 ETH = 1 ETH but 1NFT ≠ 1 NFT. If you agree that ERC-20 tokens have value, given that NFTs are a type of token, then they must have value in both scenarios. It’s just that the demand is a lot lower on one side of the fence, right? And rightly so - most owners want to flip and make money and nothing else. 

It’s worth noting that the metadata can be changed (that’s how NFTs reveal) and that they normally link to IPFS, a web api or URL to pull back the digital item. So the image, sound clip, video, digital selling point of an NFT can go offline in some cases. Then what value does it hold? It’s quite a compelling argument against them if the thing you bought for can disappear, but to each their own.",1642347523.0,2

This is not true if NFT dApp uses IPFS for artworks storage, as IPFS is an example of a content-addressable storage technology (the address of a file is only its hash).

The hash of the file on IPFS works differently than checksum. For example, it is not enough to make a very small change to the image, such as changing a single pixel.

The intention of IPFS designers was to protect data against deliberate (editing of a photo, changing a word in the text) altering the data, and not changing it as a result of accident.

First: speculative assets just about always experience price volatility, often because of expected future adoption. This is the way humans behave, and it is rational in this specific way, even though it seems irrational at arms-length. Because this is the way people behave, it should be expected. 

Second: some real artists have made real NFT art. Kevin Abosch is a widely well-regarded artist (one among many), and he has programmed the creation of NFTs as art. Art collectors would say that has value in the art marketplace. 

Third: if you’ve been in crypto for a while, you must know it works exactly this way. ICOs start making money, then you start seeing billions of new ICOs, most of which are absolutely ridiculous. New joke tokens start seeing their tokens boom, then we start seeing more and more joke tokens. 

Fourth: crypto is irrational as part of its ethos. Have you actually talked to people in the crypto space? They make zero sense most of the time, and that is perfect in its own way. Why? Because crypto has always been about doing something so different and so disruptive—so non-sensical—that regular people would finally have a chance at participating in global markets. We don’t trust intellect or reason or people in this context; instead, we trust the technology. The nature of blockchain is that we do not trust any particular individual; instead, we trust the community which sustains the interest in (and maintenance of) the blockchain. 

It is, in a way, a rebellion. All of these sensible, intelligent economic systems have left people feeling as if they are poor and without viable options. If NFTs also leave people poor and without options, well, at least it was done by choice. (“You think I’m stupid and what I’m doing is stupid?

there are those who wanna see cryptocurrency & NFT art shenanigans implode, and I don't necessarily disagree with them entirely, as there's obviously a lotta turd being churned out left and right.

but if there's this much money already poured into certain NFT's, there may be enough of a crowd who bought into the culture of it to keep it alive whether or not there is mass adoption.

might not be an accurate parallel, but I can't see myself ever being interested in buying/ selling fancy watches. It just doesn't appeal to me whatsoever. But there's a large enough cohort that buys into expensive watch collecting, and there are enough buyers and sellers.

I can see NFT art (not speaking about its other uses per se, as I have zero experience with the tech's underpinnings even if I think it's highly likely it'll be used in other ways in the future from smart people who find practical uses for it) having enough players who have dumped big money into it, who understand who's who in the scene, and are able to agree upon worth – even if others can't see it – to keep it afloat.

1) (optional) have the contract which tracks who owns how many of each type of card, allow a feature where you can freeze your ability to transfer the cards for a fixed amount of time  
2) at the start of the match, player’s decks are registered (possibly using some stuff to commit to them without revealing the content of one’s deck to the other player, but still granting them an assurance that one has the tokens for all the cards in one’s deck)  
3) pass back and forth signed messages describing moves and gamestate (and timestamps), in ways that are verifiably valid given the previous state. In order to handle the hidden information of “what cards are in your hand”, use the same techniques which have been used for preventing cheating in [online poker without a central server] .  
4) If any player makes an invalid move, the other player can prove this fact and win (presenting the proof to the smart contract), tell them to make a valid move, or, if they choose, allow the invalid move (if more than 2 players, or if someone other than these two players has an interest in the game, then all players, or a representative for all interested parties, must sign the same message agreeing to accept the invalid move as valid. Alternatively, committing to this not being a possibility can probably be done by using some kind of proof aggregation thing in order to be able to succinctly prove to the contract at the end that all the moves made were valid.)  
5) If a player doesn’t make a move within  a given time limit, then the next player can submit a dispute claim to the smart contract, either where this would count as the other player forfeiting, or skipping their turn, and where the player skipped has a given amount of time during which they can contest this.  
If the player making the claim had previously signed a move which came after the move they claimed wasn’t being made, they are cheating and they lose.  

There is a substantial issue here, where by refusing to make a move, (or, by refusing to send one’s opponent the message describing one’s move), one could force the other player to make their moves on-chain, as you say, which would be problematic.

(Of course, wouldn’t need the entire game state or move description, just a commitment, but still)  

6) finally, final move is verified as valid by the contract (or, if this would be computationally expensive, committed on the smart contract with a claimed result, and only verified by the contract if the claimed result is contested.)

__________

However, a much simpler solution, would be to not even have a smart contract have any transactions during a match at all, where except when cards are being traded/sold/issued/banned/unbanned , the clients simply, check the state of the smart contract, without any transaction happening.  

(Why do you want to be able to cryptographically validate all the moves of a game with a changing card list? That is very complicated with not much benefit.)  

If you want to have betting on the results of the match, just use a 3rd party judge (or panel of judges, depending on the importance of the match).

I don’t think there’s much tendency for judges to cheat or be bribed in big card game tournaments.

And, if there is a standard simulator which encodes the rules of the game, it becomes fairly unambiguous whether a ruling is legitimate. A rules judge who was bribed would lose all reputation as a rules judge.",1642372165.0,1

The current BTC hashrate is ~200 EH/s, so a 51% attack would need ~100 EH/s (100x10^18 H/s).

The Antminer S19 does about 100 TH/s (100x10^12 H/s), so you'd need around a million of them.

In practice that's way more than actually exist, but it's just a thought experiment.

It's a 3kW unit, so each one consumes 24x3 = 72kWh per day.

The cheapest electricity in the US is around 7c per kWh, so at that rate, you'd spend 72x0.07x10^6 = $5.02M / day to maintain a 51% attack.

Of course, that ignores the hardware costs. The retail cost per unit is $11,500, so the hardware alone would be north of $11.5B.

Edit: I just realized that technically it wouldn't be enough to have half the *existing* hashrate, you'd need to *match* the existing hashrate for a 51% attack, so you can double all those figures, and it would be more like $23B upfront + $10M/day.",1642350989.0,15

And possibly emotions of community and identity. Many people still can’t grasp it because they didn’t experience it yet.

I think NFTs are the evolution and combination of meme coins and DeFi. Less abstract, more approachable and more appealing than traditional crypto. I got a free LOOKS drop based on my NFT trading, that is currently staked at 800% APR.

Why would a company bother with that? If a game is networked, it still probably needs servers running to control things, since you can't just trust clients. A more decentralized setup that allows self-hosted or private server managed games with smaller groups is feasible, but then you've still got hosts with control. A p2p setup is possible, but then we're getting into a really limited set of games and a lot more complexity for the net code of a game. If you have your own servers to power the networked aspects of a game, then why not have them vend such data as well?

The reality is that reading data from the blockchain directly is pretty difficult today without running a node on the network.

A potentially better way to achieve similar results to what you described would be for a company to have a fully public dataset available at all times. A simple readonly API for it works just fine. If the company servers ever shut off, the community can fork the last state from it and let that be the source of truth. Different clients can all individually fork off on their own as well.

False. Understanding what makes proof of work the single known way to distribute control without central permission takes people a while. Proof of stake has been around and recognized to be an irrelevant fallacy for most of decade, at least in technically literate circles.

Sustainability of completely permissioned centralized systems doesn't really matter if a permissioned centralized system isn't your goal, and if it is we already had much more efficient systems for achieving that for decades.

Also very few seem to grasp the incentives at play in Proof of Work systems which goes far beyond just hash power.

It's incredibly obvious that proof of stake requires permission of previous stake owner to gain any access to control since tokens have owners and stake owners are literally rewarded for withholding control forever. Needing central permission to control is central control. Not only can proof of stake not be ever classified as decentralized, it's literally incentivizing continuous centralization of control.

Proof of work relies on permissionless external resources (matter/energy) for this reason with unforgeably continuous costs for all making it necessary to give up control to break even. It managed to do something completely unprecedented and unique - to prove something was done in outside world on-chain. There is nothing like it.

This is not the case, proof-of-stake coins are inflationary meaning they print coins each block, in many coins, being a large staker means your coins only keep pace with increasing supply (assuming total value of the coin's market stays the same). Staking rewards are generally linear and proportional to the amount of coin you have, so you don't automatically have all wealth converging into a couple of large addresses.

I see it as AR more than VR. 

Imagine adding ambiance/decorations to a restaurant through AR glasses. 

Imagine Pokemon Go but even more immersive. You can have subsets of people walking around interacting with the Pokemon Go universe, where they see Pokemon around them to catch, while another subset of people are tuned into the Avengers, Harry Potter, or LotR metaverse, with whatever that entails. It’d be like LARPing but to the extreme.

Imagine coming home and your entire house is decorated with NFTs: if you want to rearrange things for decor, instead of having to physically move things, you can just move them virtually. You could have a pet dragon, fountains of lava, unicorns, mermaids, and whatever else you want in your home.

In all these interactions, the physical world would still be present, but you are augmenting what’s already there with things that are only possibly virtually. You can even tie NFTs to physical objects. So, for example, you could have a wand that’s just some stick object in the real world, but because you own the NFT for that wand, you can use that stick in the real world to cast spells in the metaverse.

I don’t know if this vision will ever come to pass, but that’s how I can see the metaverse having the most tangible success, rather than some VR game everyone’s playing.",1642103603.0,28

Yes !!

I'm a long time gamer, started with Pokemon Yellow and up to today's games. I've always been a fan not only of playing but of the whole video game culture and the progression of game play along the years.

I was able to try out a VR game about a year ago, and while I thought it would be boring and not so revolutionary, I was hooked up as soon as I entered the tutorial.

So far I didn't dive deep into it because it's not really my cup of tea, but I was really amazed by the possibilities with a technology and games that are still young in my opinion. The immersion was great and to me it's one of the most important part for many games that are supposed to put you in a character shoes or that let you dive in a specific universe.

 So I want to try it out and I want to follow how things will evolve around that, and I think that great things will be possible, despite the fact that it'll probably won't be used the way it's supposed to be (like how social networks are bringing up so many opportunities but are used in a way that's useless and annoying for most).

And don't get me wrong, I will still want and love to go outside camping or whatever, but if the metaverse is gonna be here and if it end up being popular, I want to check how it is at the very least.",1642106288.0,9

VR/AR is as stated fairly new but the actual concept of a metaverse is not. GTA, Assassin's Creed, C.O.D and many gen games all need a metaverse where players can interact. where crypto and finances go is more towards RP/MMO style games. there was this one game that was very popular called imvu. it actually had its own metaverse and interactions to buy real clothes or furniture brands but to style your in game avi and rooms. 

i believe that as we go forward with communication and social experiences more apps and sites withove towards the RP style interfaces. i can definitely see Instagram doing this. there are many light weight apps and games that can implement a full metaverse/market system that works for the masses. 

you could go on and on with different use cases and reasons/ideas for metaverses but it all boils down to the original meaning and social interaction. there is this ome show called ""westworld"" thats based on a metaverse type. it's probably actually somewhere in the works as we speak. but that would be large scale.

Whereas I could easily see the general public adopt AR (this is, bringing digital elements into the real world). I would happily wear a pair of glasses and see avatars seeing around on my couch or have a wall turn into shelves of items etc... Not to mention a myriad of other applications for both general use and productivity. It's basically reality enhanced.

I could imagine a future, where you have a device capable of AR and VR that's no more cumbersome than a pair of glasses. At that point I could see the general population adopt the tech.",1642147523.0,1

Like, travel the world, see the inside of volcanos, skydive, walk on the ledge of sky-high buildings, talk to people all over the world, and just experience things that aren’t easily accessible in life.

We all don’t even have an idea of everything VR is capable of but to say the least, history classes will be able to virtually show their students exactly what the books are talking about, gloves and probably full body suits will be developed to feel things in VR -perhaps even taste things.

Of course, it’s going to be big for gamers but eventually, a lot of us will be going to work in the metaverse. So many people are already working from home. The transition is slowly happening.

# Social interaction

Online gaming is fun for the social interactions, not the P2E hype nor game genres. Social media & media conferencing is good (if anonymousity mantained) & bad (if IRL identity locked on). Why? Me personally more readily open up myself in anonymous & make friends in like, than being around bunches of elderly that always raise issue of respect & so called ""more wise & experiences"" in life (Hence the death of FB). We trancended the era of respect based on age, race, geographical boundaries, social rank; into respect based on open wisdom & ideologies.

# Administration

Regulations is important in any interaction platforms. However, I trust consistent regulation by artificial intelligence more than by human gut feeling. Guess this blockchain not entirely trustless. AI is emotionless (sin-less), almost to the level of gods. Yes, technology improve interconnectivity like shopping & services, but the administration rules (by single authority) the one that most people complain. Also, platform administration exposure to the users also allows more tolerance & understanding why certain platform actions are taken, instead of shear blame of greed or irresponsibility.

# Others factors

I don't understand the need for VR (some people have 3D sickness) & NFT (abstract artistic value that only the crazy rich can apprehend & accept) too. In game items trading might increase game interactivity, but I understand no further than that. For example, minecraft players can play anonymously (though certain regulation by AI is needed) for social & trading for some in game item might solve scam issue, but everything else is clueless to me.",1642309223.0,1

424,CryptoTechnology,Do you genuinely want to use the metaverse?,wballard8,1642102601.0,336,122,0.93,"Never said it should. It should cost as much as people are willing to pay and sell them for. The costs of NFTs currently are outrageous and unrealistic. Current costs are not what a healthy metaverse would look like. Maybe for collector’s items. But who knows. They’ll cost whatever people are willing to buy and sell em for.

For example, if you have an NFT for a wand in the Harry Potter metaverse that allows you to perform certain very powerful spells, and there are only a few copies of that wand in existence, then it makes sense that it would cost a lot. Now, if that same wand existed in another metaverse and did the exact same things but was abundant, people could switch to that metaverse instead and capitalism would take over from there to determine the optimal price. It all depends on how well developed the metaverse is and how much people are willing to spend for a product in one metaverse environment as opposed to another. 

I’d be willing to bet people would spend a lot more for a powerful wand in the official Harry Potter metaverse than for that same wand in a random no-name metaverse. But if that random no-name metaverse has good developers that create a fun, desirable environment, then that wand could then increase in price.

I’m assuming here that there will be multiple metaverses because I find it hard to believe that there will be one metaverse with a monopoly on the entire space, though that’s entirely possible (could see an Apple vs Android metaverse type of thing happening). If there were to be one main metaverse though, you can bet your ass that any items that are scarce will be expensive as hell. 

I imagine there might be one main metaverse platform that will prevail over others, as it has the best design / SDK, and the majority of developers will choose to develop using their platform, similar to Apple with iPhones. Then other competitor metaverse platforms will try to compete and will be around but won’t be as prevalent as the main one for whatever reason (like Android / Windows phones).",1642115034.0,2

In the short term it is more likely that AR will gain broader adoption (esp. with Apple Glasses, Meta’s partnership with Ray Ban, Snap Spectacles, etc.) while VR continues to evolve in its own niche (gaming, entertainment, perhaps some engineering).

It’s thought by several psychiatrists that the reason the rates of depression, anxiety, suicide, and suffering in general is rising so much in developed nations is due to an increased level of dopamine from all the stimulation and “feel good” products we have. Your brain has to counteract this excess dopamine and it does so by creating periods of artificial suffering to reach homeostasis again. 

In my eyes this seems like creating a life that’s quite unfulfilling, but one that seems cool in theory. You can essentially make everything exactly the way you want with little to no struggle.

Slightly harder to not realize that one isn’t following when reading than when watching.  

The important thing is doing. 

Get an interpreter or compiler installed and working, and get a very simple program to run (this may be copied and pasted, though it may be better to type it in yourself), and then come up with the simplest change you can think of to what you want it to do, that you think you can make, and make that change.
(I imagine you’ve progressed past “Hello, World.”, but if you were at that stage, a decent first thing to try would be “Hello, Wokeman1.”)

 If it doesn’t work, great! You need to be used to that experience. Figure out why.  
If you get an error message you don’t understand, look it up. 
(Though, before you look it up, read it. I mean, if it is many lines long, you don’t need to read the whole thing, but like, you wouldn’t paste the whole thing into google either.). 

Fix the error.
Get it working.  
Make other changes, of increasing difficulty, which require gradually more understanding.

(Fix the errors you encounter each time.
“There are two alternating steps in programming, adding bugs, and removing them.”)

Ask yourself what you can do with the things you’ve understood so far.  
What would be something neat you could do? What can you do with what you’ve learned so far that is potentially surprising that you can do it with that?
What’s something you aren’t quite sure how to accomplish, but you feel like you’re close to being able to?  
What’s the part that’s missing? Break it down.  
Look it up.  

You don’t need to learn all the language features right away, but you should be on the lookout for language features that you aren’t experienced with yet, and which would make things easier/cleaner (or make things possible).  

If it feels like there should be a way to do something, and it would be useful to you, look it up, see if there is a way.

It reminds me of another crazy idea though: create a ledger for debts and let the community build various coexisting gift economy systems on top.

1. The ledger only stores debts between accounts. Zero is the default, `2^64-1` is the maximum.
2. Two accounts can together agree to change the balance between them however they want.
3. Transactions form something like a DAG. Everything is voluntary, so there's little need for the ledger to actually reach consensus. Let other layers worry about it.

Such a system would have no speculative value and would not work as a value transfer mechanism by itself because anyone can create two accounts and set balance between them to `2^64-1`.

However it may work as a mechanism for scaling real world trust, similar to [Hawala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawala) and other [informal value transfer systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_value_transfer_system).

If Alice and Bob have a relationship and Bob and Charlie have a relationship but Alice and Charlie don't want a relationship, then Bob can be an intermediary when Alice wants to sell something to Charlie. Charlie declares debt to Bob, Bob declares debt to Alice, Alice hands over the goods off-chain.

The same process can be automated for chains of any length. The only requirement is that an escrow hands over Alice's goods to Charlie at the same time Charlie confirms the chain trade.

TL;DR: automate debt accounting in a decentralized way. No enforcement, just accounting. Intuitively it feels like something that has no reason not to work.",1642102177.0,1

Say that one week there's a few strains, and the only difference between them is the transaction fee that goes to the miner/staker. One strain is set at 0, one at some other value, and one at a massively high other value. The producers will choose not to support the 0-payout strain, so it'll die. And on the other hand, the consumers won't choose the massively high fee strain, so it'll die. Eventually, consensus will settle on a fair price for the transaction... but even if a consumer for some reason decided to pay the higher price (maybe in exchange for a expected faster transfer?), then that would still get put on the common ledger, just with a different set of rules applied (higher fee being the different rule). Another strain might support some kind of new technology, but might also incur some additional fee. A strain like this might stay around for a long time, being used by people interested in the new tech who want to pay the fee, but ignored by people who aren't interested in using that tech. Either way, all transfers get written to the same master ledger.

&#x200B;

Well I think there's a few reasons.

A) It helps to quickly achieve a viable compromise because there's new forks being made all the time and old ones getting destroyed.

B) It unites these chains into one chain with variable, simultaneous rules. There's no need to pick between btc or ltc in the long term, because you just have coin and choose which rules you want to follow for each exchange. Your coin is immortal, even if the rules that were in governance when you bought it are no longer around.

C) It prevents the exact thing you bring up. Having old tech like btc and classic eth hanging around crowds the space, and puts money in inferior technology. In an ecosystem like the one I propose, a coin like btc would probably have died off a long time ago - only to be replaced with something much better for the producers and consumers. More people get to use better technology, which leads to faster adoption.

D) This produces rule governance like 3rd gen coins always try to achieve, but without actual voting or governance. Even coins like btc, eth, ada still have hard fast rules and ""commands handed down from above"" that neither the producer nor the consumer have any influence over. By distributing power to those who use it, the people who use it can mold the product to fit their interests. The same is true for producers (miners/stakers) who now have some influence over their own life. Agency produces action. Here, the consumer and producer are both given agency and opportunity to shape their own future. And even better, the two are forced to compromise towards a solution which works for both of them.",1642081685.0,-1

This goes against what a blockchain, let alone network is used for.

Programs want just enough data so they can do the computation themselves- not doing computation all the time on the network. Crypto does this because of the protocol which encrypts everything before going on chain.

The premise is that content creators can post content and set a price in FileCoins. The media is encrypted prior to posting to IPFS. Consumers would need to pay for an unlock key. The unlock keys are based on the consumer's public key, therefore can't be shared or reused by others. Now for the ""mining"" part. When someone downloads the content, they are getting it from IPFS, a distributed network of storage providers (seeds). When someone pays for the unlock code, the network scans to see who is seeding the file and gives half the rewards to them and half to the content creator. So, if you want the content for ""free"", you need to seed it to many others. The seeding part is optional, it is a cost in storage and bandwidth to the user. 

Users can also seed other content that they never intend to unlock just to earn FileCoin in order to unlock a file of their choice at a later date. It's also similar to the model of BAT. In BAT, you watch ads to earn BAT then you later spend BAT to view premium content.

As for protections, I think the only thing FileCoin could do is prevent duplicate hashes from being posted. I wouldn't be able to download your media, unlock it, then post it as my own...

I’m imaging your system working something like this: all computers on the network are mining crypto. As the miners run, they allocate their mined coins to various wallets, depend on what  “file” they are mining for. 

Web Page miners are the closest thing to this sort of system currently existing, and they illustrate some of the problems with this system. The problem is that big players can deploy powerful machines, which will be so powerful compared to a consumer device, that the consumer device cannot mine enough coin for it to be worth it. The only way for it to be profitable is if many consumer devices all work together for the benefit of a single person for a very long time - the more powerful the biggest players are, the more small players need to work together, and for longer periods of time. 

This makes it only practical for malware, so that many consumer devices all work together for the benefit of one person, enough to compete with the biggest machines on the network.",1642079434.0,1

Well, maybe it isn’t the best option, if there’s better ways I don’t know about.

The crypto community feels like the type of crowd that would be most interested in it. The inspiration for the idea came from a mix of the Brave Browser and NFTs, so I just assume crypto is the arena in which this idea would work best.

With your suggestion of shasum, does it have the same decentralization and public ledger security that blockchain offers? Does it require or allow any kind of third party involvement to verify? Would it work with cryptocurrency and crypto mining in the same integrated way a blockchain does? Could it be coded to survive copying and peer-to-peer sharing and still work every time the file and/or its copies is played in perpetuity (or at least, as long as the creator stays connected to the system, at which point the mining could either stop or just all go to the viewer)? If so, then maybe it would be the best way to go, but I just assumed blockchain would be the best way to go about something like this.


“Would you use Youtube if every video you watched, arbitrary code by the video creator is run?”

No, but… this wouldn’t be “arbitrary” code. It would be an established system that people agree to use, and the only thing that would change from video to video or creator to creator is the content and/or the wallet the crypto is being sent to. That’s it. Everything else would be as consistent, verifiable and consented to as using a certain video codec to watch a certain video format. What’s “arbitrary” about that?

I’ve already addressed the concern about trojans, malware and piracy, and how they’re already a problem with every form of content distribution we already use.

Nothing’s stopping Disney from putting malware into the code for streaming Disney+ content or downloading a piece of paid content… except for the fact that if they did that, people would find out and nobody would use Disney+ anymore.

Nothing’s stopping people from putting malware into torrent files on The Pirate Bay. And they do! But guess what?! People still take their chances and download pirated torrents every damn day, learning to avoid certain uploaders if they gain a bad reputation, etc… but there’s still tons of trusted content that is clean and accessible, and most importantly FREE at the point of transaction, which is why so many people continue to pirate content. 

That is pretty much all I want. That exact same model as the torrent/piracy system, except in a legitimate, legal system that would ensure the content owners get paid for their work, instead of getting nothing like they currently do from pirated torrents. They’d be the ones uploading their own content, instead of pirates who stole it.

And again, even if pirates do still steal it and try to upload on the same system (which wouldn’t work anyway, because the system wouldn’t verify a duplicate upload from someone else), or on some other platform, what could a pirate offer to people that would make them want to download their copy of the file, instead of the creator’s copy? Nothing. Because the creator’s copy is every bit as free and accessible, with the added advantage of having legitimacy and reputation behind it. If a creator so chose, they could find whoever uploaded the pirated version, because the blockchain would provide a public record of it, and charge them for stealing content, just as you would with any copyright infringement done via today’s technology. The public record of the blockchain would itself be a disincentive to pirate, on top of there already being less of an incentive to pirate already-free-and-accessible content. For the same reason most Youtubers don’t have to worry about their content being pirated, the content already being free tends to nip the desire for a pirated version in the bud. People pirate Netflix stuff, though, because Netflix has a subscription paywall. This is why the no-cost-to-the-consumer part is so important.

“Do you know about the log4j exploit? It’s similar in that this would open a window to remote code execution.”

Okay, I get that this is a potential risk, but again… why is that different for this idea than it already is anything and everything that people download and use on their computers? How is it so much more of a concern for this than it is for, say, downloading and running a node for the PI Network, for example, or any other blockchain? How is it more of a risk than what a lot of creators already do by selling a downloadable MP4 through their website?

I mean, is this not what blockchain technology is all about? A system of verification via nodes on a network of computers? The technology/coding expertise needed to figure how to make it as secure as possible would be a given in developing this idea, but I feel like a lot of that work has already been done in blockchains of various uses. What you’re asking me is essentially the same as asking why Bitcoin should be trusted. Does installing a Bitcoin wallet and transferring Bitcoin to it not open these same type of concerns? If not, why not? If so, why doesn’t it invalidate mining or storing Bitcoin, but it invalidates watching videos via the same type of system?

618,CryptoTechnology,Would this be possible?,AWS-77,1641991253.0,162,13,0.61,"Well yeah, the idea is entirely based on the collective mining power of as many viewers as you can get. The consumers would be completely aware of this and agree to it and everything, so I don't know why you're characterizing it as ""malware"". Malware is malware because it's ""malicious"", as in people don't want it in their computers because it does damage or slows things down and often they don't even know about it or can't get rid of it. This wouldn't be anything like that, so how is it malware?

The consumer would download the file and when they open it, they're met with a dialog box that says something like ""Playing this file will run a crypto-miner for the duration of the content. Do you consent?"" ... if they don't, they don't do it. If they do, they click Yes, and the file checks with the system to verify the file is legit and untampered with, passes copyright checks, etc, and then plays it. The miner runs in tandem with the playing of the file, so imagine you make a 10-minute video, so 10-minutes of mining time per view, and get as much as 1000 viewers to view it... that's 10,000 minutes of mining time on your video. Now imagine you get a million views. A hundred million views. A billion views. Like I said, it wouldn't have to be much mined per view for it to add up to a big sum for the creator. If you don't get many views, you don't get many rewards, but what else is new in the world of content monetization?

The concern about people with more powerful machines hogging all the rewards doesn't seem relevant, when the rewards are going to the creator anyway, from wherever they happen to be when they're mined. I'd think that would actually discourage people from lending more processing power than they would need to just to get the video to play, because there'd be no incentive for them to if they're not getting the rewards. They just want the video to play. You could set like a base minimum amount of processing power that's required to verify the file and ensure a base amount of mining, and then add the option to allow more processing power than that, if you wanted, which would raise the collective mining power and generate more rewards for the creator per view, so it'd be an act of generosity on the viewer's behalf to donate their processing power, which I'd imagine people would do if they really like a creator (could even include a tipping option as well if they want to be even more generous). As long as the minimum is an amount that the average iPhone could do (which, come on, those things are getting pretty impressively powerful now and only increasing going forward), then it would be enough to make the system work and get some amount of mining rewards out of each view. If the person's device isn't powerful enough to even reach the minimum, then it would have to be a pretty old device and they should accept the consequences of their lagging on keeping up with technology, the same as if your old phone doesn't support a new app or OS.

So looking at it this way, if the average processing power across all viewers' devices was enough to generate, say, a cent's worth of crypto for about 10 minutes of viewing, then if you got a million views, you'd have a thousand bucks for 1 million views on a 10 minute video. The same for half a million views on a 20 minute video and so forth. Feature films could generate around $120,000 from a million views at that rate. Now imagine the value of the cryptocurrecy goes up to make it so you're mining $1 worth for 10 minutes of viewing. A 2-hour movie now makes $12 million from only 1 million views. A 3-hour movie makes $18 million. Now imagine you're Hollywood, where you can attract tens of millions or hundreds of millions of viewers with movies that people will watch again and again for years to come... think major studios and rich filmmakers might be interested in investing at this point? Crypto price goes up, rewards go up... so on and so on.

Maybe those amounts are overly-optimistic, but it would all depend on how well the cryptocurrecy's price does, and like I said, if the system attracted the attention of the likes of Hollywood, Bollywood, the music industry, television studios, news media, etc... that price could get pretty damn high with not a lot of mining needed per view to generate substantial rewards from mass amounts of views.",1642088757.0,1

&#x200B;

>The inspiration for the idea came from a mix of the Brave Browser and NFTs, so I just assume crypto is the arena in which this idea would work best.

The basic attention token (BAT) is pretty much as close as a solution creators can get to getting paid in a safe and reliable way for their content. It trades off reliance to third party advertisers to user safety and ease of use. In a sense, your proposed idea is similar to brave but with this balance tweaked.

&#x200B;

>With your suggestion of shasum, does it have the same decentralization and public ledger security that blockchain offers?

shasum is a checksum  program that can produce a deterministic hash string given the same input. This could be used in combination with digital signatures to verify that the file contents + signature is valid making files linked to their original creator as long as the file and signature have not been modified. This is not hard to implement using existing code libraries. It is decentralized (trustless) in that the user is able to verify for themselves that a file is untampered. This would just be a technique that could be integrated into the entire ecosystem but does not offer middle man less content payments.

&#x200B;

>What’s “arbitrary” about that?

It's arbitrary in that it would be different for each file. Each file/content creator would have to set their own crypto mining script to run. And people with bad intent can do much worse than having a crypto miner run while the file is open.

&#x200B;

>And again, even if pirates do still steal it and try to upload on the same system (which wouldn’t work anyway, because the system wouldn’t verify a duplicate upload from someone else)

Your file system will still use existing file formats such as mp4 for videos and mp3 for audio under the layer of abstraction the new format provides. People can and definitely will extract the underlying content though reverse engineering or what not to extract the raw content. Then these files can be wrapped in your new file again but with the pirate's payout address.

&#x200B;

>what could a pirate offer to people that would make them want to download their copy of the file, instead of the creator’s copy?

The pirate's copy is there to deceive unsuspecting people and ""steal"" views from the original creator.

&#x200B;

>If a creator so chose, they could find whoever uploaded the pirated version, because the blockchain would provide a public record of it, and charge them for stealing content, just as you would with any copyright infringement done via today’s technology.

You seem to want the files tracked via blockchain. But what is the merit in tracking static files on a decentralised server? Again, blockchain is overkill for your idea. Also, just from the nature of blockchain and international law, the creator won't be able to find out who the pirates are and take them to court. A content publisher, whether original or pirate, will always just be a public key represented on the blockchain making it impossible to find out who owns the public key.

&#x200B;

>why is that different for this idea than it already is anything and everything that people download and use on their computers?

Because the file type you have proposed is an EXECUTABLE script/program with attached content. People go around torrenting movies off the internet because the file format is just a multimedia storage dump where no code is executed. A crypto miner is fundamentally a script that runs on a computer where as a MP4 file is a bunch of data that is interpreted and displayed by a MP4 player. It has no other capabilities that storing data.

&#x200B;

>Does installing a Bitcoin wallet and transferring Bitcoin to it not open these same type of concerns?

Because Bitcoin wallets don't execute crypto miners or any other arbitrarily set code. Your system would be similar to having bitcoin wallets that allow people to send code fragments to each other and then having those fragments executed on the recipients machine when they open their wallet.

&#x200B;

>All that’s different is the code would contain the data that makes up a video instead of a Bitcoin token

That's what you are misunderstand. When you make or receive a bitcoin transaction, no code is executed on your local hardware where as with your system, a crypto miner, which is CODE, is executed on your machine. The difference being, the file affects your machine where as a bitcoin transaction cannot. There cannot be a zero trust model going on when you have to trust the content creator that they haven't included malicious code in their content.

&#x200B;

I don't even think the piracy potential of your system is even an issue. It's just a side effect. The biggest issue is that the model allows for scripts/code to be executed on user's machines and the single point of trust is the file uploader. This is  a fundamental flaw that I would face if I was tasked with creating such a system. I'm sure there are smarter people who can come up with ideas to make middle-man less content payment systems or better yet implement your system in a way that is safe for users, but I, and many people in this thread, don't seem to think that is possible.",1642163412.0,1

In short: it’s a good idea, it’s just that nobody has been able to figure out how to actually do it in practice. 

As I see it, the crux of the problem is wrapped up with block rewards. Let’s start with blockchains that have constant block rewards - meaning, the amount of crypto mined per block is constant no matter how many people are mining.  The amount of crypto you mine is therefore approximately proportionate to the _fraction_ of total compute power your device has compared to the compute power of the rest of the computers in the network combined. With Bitcoin, this means that if you mine on a cellphone for a hundred years, you won’t make a single penny (or something on that scale). 

On the other hand, let’s say your blockchain has variable rewards, so that more mining means more crypto created per block. Here, you face a different problem: inflation of the coin. If the rate of inflation goes up as mining increases, the value of the coin may plummet. I won’t matter if it means that low powered devices are able to mine at least a small number of coins, because those coins will have so little value it wont matter.

Here’s what would happen in the system your imagining: people would mine crypto for themselves by consuming the content that they create, and they would do this with powerful machines.  (Nobody has been able to figure out a way of preventing this - for instance, it’s not very difficult make a single powerful machine appear like many smaller machines, so you couldn’t just make a rule preventing large machines) This would drive down the amount of crypto that could be mined on consumer devices - because it’s not about how powerful they are, it’s about how powerful they are _compared to the other miners_. 

I see how you’re trying to construct this system, so that collectively lots of people watching the same video will end up mining enough coin to be worth it together. So far, nobody has been able to figure out the economics of this well enough to make this actually work in practice. In the best case, a small amount of crypto would be mined for videos that go viral, most crypto goes to miners watching their own videos, and every other video would get zero crypto. 

This is why I said it’s well suited for malware. I’m not saying that your imagining malware, I’m just saying that it does actually generate money efficiently in a malware context. With malware, you’d gets lots of peoples devices all mining for you for long periods of time- and this would function similar to the “watching your own videos” scenario I described, which is how most coins would be mined. 

All that being said - it’s still a nice idea! It’s just that there are difficult problems that nobody has been able to solve yet that need to be solved for it to work.",1642111025.0,1

Nobody would be able to repost content on the system or post copyrighted material they don’t own without it being treated the exact same way Youtube would treat it.

The verification would make it so that every file downloaded from a creator’s upload would need to be verified that it matches the original upload, or it won’t play. If someone tries to repost it on the system to monetize it themselves and cut out the creator… the system would detect that upload’s content as matching the content of the original upload, the same way Youtube’s algorithm detects and blocks copyrighted material. The same would go for posting copyrighted material that’s not on the system, where the owners of the copyright in question would have the same recourse they currently have with Youtube. Whatever the copyright laws in the country in question are, they would apply and be enforceable by the system’s algorithms.

I figured this all would have been clear when I said that the files need to be verified to work. It’s part of the reason I assume blockchain technology would work, because it’s all about transactions being approved by verification of authenticity in a decentralized peer-to-peer network.

I feel like you’re still kinda missing the point of the collective mining and the fact that the rewards go to the creator, not the people doing the mining. It doesn’t matter if a person with a cellphone doesn’t have enough power to ever get rewards… as long as they’re contributing even a tiny bit to the collective mining power, then that’s all that matters. To the creator, it doesn’t matter if the rewards are coming from a million people or 1 guy with a supercomputer… it’s all the same to the creator. The point of having a large pool of consumers viewing the content is to spread that around as much as possible, and wherever the balance falls in terms of who’s doing the most mining, then so be it. It’s not a competition between the miners like it is when they’re competing for the rewards, because they’re all just working together to reward the creator. I think that requires a fundamentally different way of thinking about it compared to normal crypto mining, and I’m not sure you or anyone else here is really grasping that aspect of it. If you’re saying that no current blockchain technology could work this way, then I guess I am actually suggesting an evolution of the technology that would require a whole new type of collective mining method to be developed. And yes, I realize that’s a big ask.


The issue of people just viewing their own content to reward themselves… again, so be it, if that happens. I don’t think that would prevent them from still contributing a substantial amount to other creators, because as much as I personally love watching my own content (I made it the way I like it, after all!)… I can’t spend ALL my time watching my own content. Sooner or later, I’m gonna wanna watch some other people’s shit. I’m gonna wanna throw on a movie or tv show or any of the type of content I’m interested in. Nobody would ever JUST watch their own content and NEVER anybody else’s. I mean, do current filmmakers who have movies on Netflix just stream their own shit all day long to rack up views on it so Netflix pays them more? Probably not. And even if they did, I don’t think that’s necessarily a problem at all. In the case of a blockchain, as long as they’re running the node, they would still be contributing to powering the blockchain with their mining, so even if they’re just watching their own content, they wouldn’t just be free-loading.

On the issue of inflation, I do see that being a potential problem, but not necessarily any more so than any cryptocurrency that isn’t hard-capped on supply like Bitcoin is (Ethereum or Doge, for instance). Maybe it could be hard-capped and still work somehow? But I figure not really, once all the coins are mined. Ideally, it wouldn’t be capped, so it can go on in perpetuity, and the creators with a vested interest in keeping the price up would keep re-investing some of their profits back into the system. And again, just imagine how much investment capital would be pumped into it if the likes of Hollywood et al got on board. I think that would overcome inflation for a pretty good while at least. I mean, for example, how long do we think Ethereum can stay valuable enough without a hard-cap to prevent inflation? For that matter, how long do we think fiat currency can remain valuable enough to keep the economy functioning with all this inflation going on? It’s a widespread problem, so again, if other systems that face these same problems have managed to work well enough for as long as they have and/or will… this system could too.

And finally, yes, I certainly understand this is all tough stuff to figure out and make work, but that’s why I came here to see what the actual obstacles are.

Antivir software: all antivit software has a fundamental flaw, it can only find already known malware, it is mathematical impossible to find out what a pice of code does(called the halting problem).

Walled garden: this defeats the whole idea of crypto and blockchain, if you have a central authority like apple(the classic example for a walled garden) they can just give out coins, you dont need to form consent between individuals anymore. You just invented a central bank/company that sells virtual coins and allows its users to interact with their API.

630,CryptoTechnology,2 questions about blockchain supply chains?,The_GodKing,1641897819.0,56,14,1.0,"This article is useful for understanding the applications of blockchains for supply chains:

https://hbr.org/amp/2020/05/building-a-transparent-supply-chain

Blockchain technology has a few beneficial characteristics that you mentioned: immutability, transparency, and decentralization. However, private rather than public blockchains can be designed in a centralized way that still utilizes the other benefits. This is what IBM, Walmart, and some other companies are doing for supply chain blockchain tech. Some highlights from the article:

“A blockchain is valuable partly because it comprises a chronological string of blocks integrating all three types of flows in the transaction and captures details that aren’t recorded in a financial-ledger system. Moreover, each block is encrypted and distributed to all participants, who maintain their own copies of the blockchain. Thanks to these features, the blockchain provides a complete, trustworthy, and tamperproof audit trail of the three categories of activities in the supply chain.”

“Blockchain thus greatly reduces, if not eliminates, the kind of execution, traceability, and coordination problems that we’ve discussed. Since participants have their own individual copies of the blockchain, each party can review the status of a transaction, identify errors, and hold counterparties responsible for their actions. No participant can overwrite past data because doing so would entail having to rewrite all subsequent blocks on all shared copies of the blockchain.”",1641953053.0,8

NFTs are, as you said, an entry in a database. By themselves, they are useless, just as useless as a monkey picture, a ""plot of land"" in a game that never launches, etc.

But your house deed, or your car registration are also a registries in a database somewhere...  the difference is the correct people pay attention to that database entry, and act accordingly.

NFTs are the same... by themselves they are just a piece of information saying ""bob owns XYZ"", but if a government minted then, and recognized the NFT as the deed to your house, then it's a deed. If a sports company mints them, and recognizes them as a valid ticket, then it's a ticket. If EA recognizes that NFT as your legendary pink camo skin, then the NFT IS a pink camo skin.

Making normal ""database entries"" into NFT has some disadvantages. For example, manipulating them (buying, selling, minting) has an inherent network cost to it. They are slower than printing a paper ticket, or saving a database record to a centralized database, etc.

They also have advantages: They are in a public space so they can be verified (travel companies can't overbook a plane without it being noticed, EA can't mint more than 100 of the ""Only 100 limited edition Messi shirt""), also, you can trade or sell the NFT to whoever you want (when you get bored of that pink camo skin for example), also, no-one needs to know WHO you are, whoever can cryptographically prove they own the NFT ""own"" the asset the NFT represents.",1641815172.0,17

653,CryptoTechnology,Giving life to NFT's,AnonymousOceanStorm,1641810292.0,202,50,0.8,"Some comments:

1. NFTs are tokens, not the art. You are not paying to obtaint the artefact, you are paying to be registered as the token-owner.

2. Blockchains have limited and costly storage, whereas artworks have presumably high definition preferences. So art is not stored on the chain. Instead, a pointer to a URL is stored. Presumably that contains the requisite art, but if the server goes down/stops serving it/serves something else then you won't find your chosen artwork there, you'll find a 404 or whatever.

3. Blockchains are deterministic - a block has to be verified, which means everyone verifying it has to reach the same conclusion about the resulting block.  In some chains (Blockchain, Ethereum) the entity mining a block is unknown, so you can have future information which isn't known until the block begins to be mined, but you can't insert randomness inside the block in any chain I've seen.

4. As blocks have to be verified, everyone can run the algorithm to work out what the block contains. So even if you did store the artefact on chain, everyone can check that the new version of the artefact is correct, so they can also generate it.

5. Blockchains solve one specific problem: that in a digital era where all information is easily perfectly copied, it is hard to construct a system that enforces scarcity. So NFTs are tokens which are constructed to be scarce, in as much as you need the owner's permission to modify the ledger entry. Trying to use this system to create a non-copyable or non-replicable artefact misses the point; artefacts are assumed to be replicated perfectly.

6. Suppose you wanted to create such a system to create a time-dependent artefact, e.g. it has the date in the corner which is updated every day, and you still want this on the chain because you want that time-dependence to be independent of any centralized image server. This would mean that at least one block of the chain every day has to include the regeneration of your image, and you would have to pay the gas fees for this regeneration, every time.

To be honest, this goes against the point of a distributed ledger - if you want to prove you're the current owner of the token, you point to the public ledger and let people check for themselves.

If you want to create an artefactory which combines your artefact with the date and your ownership proof, then that might be a fun service, but it's one that would exist parallel to the ledger, not on it or generated by it.",1641838598.0,1

My gut feeling is no, because blockchains in general and autonomous contract chains like Ethereum in particular act like one collectively-run, slow computer. So requiring that it does a computation so unreasonably hard that no one could get to the answer quicker seems not to fit.

It might be possible with a function as you describe, in that the verification doesn't have to be as slow, but you still require the computation to be performed by every mining node, and if the computation wasn't contained and continued in every block, then it could be outpaced. 

None of this improves the energy wastage argument against PoW chains.

Ultimately assuming that some function's eventual output can't be predicted by someone out there with a faster computer ignores the reality that there are some people out there with faster computers.

Fees have several purposes:

* pay miners (and proposers on the beacon chain)
* prevent loops and infinitely execution of pseudo-turing complete code
* Gas arbitrage

EIP-1559's purpose is to make fees more predictable, not necessarily to make it cheaper. And it also keeps the overall monetary inflation almost negligible. (Despite most people misunderstanding, its current circulating supply is less inflationary than Bitcoin's, but monetary inflation isn't necessarily bad in the first place.)

Without high fees, the network security degrades, and you can't expect it to hold on altruism alone.

Ethereum's ecosystem is sustainable indefinitely even with its proof of work consensus. Bitcoin and most blockchains are unsustainable with current transaction fees. When Bitcoin's block subsidy declines by 99% in 30 years, its transaction fees are probably going to go up 5-50x. Similarly, many blockchains subsidize their block rewards and staking for 5-10 years. Those blockchains will also need to transition to a different economic model once they approach their time bomb.

Yes it's still expensive but at the time it was expensive AND unpredictable meaning you could pay $250 for a transaction and still have it not go through and lose the fee anyway because you didn't accurately predict the cost. I think they acted out of pressure and really pushed this protocol through out of needing to act. 

Prioritizing deflation through burning also gives a little head start to the idea of rewarding those with a bigger hold of ETH which was never really a thing before. The idea is that over a long enough time, the more ETH you hold the better off you'll be if it's deflationary and it's meant to reward those people, not average joe users. Again I'm not sure exactly why this was prioritized over sidechain development but here we are, it's just how the devs decided to go about it. I'm speculating but maybe they saw the rise of other L2s and sidechains and see that as a bandaid for the time being, allowing them to focus their energy on the PoS merge/difficulty bomb which seems to be their #1 priority at this point, and putting sharding on the backburner for now",1641911422.0,2

No. If the market decides that a unit of gas is worth 100 gwei, then it's worth 100 gwei at that specific point in time. The fact that ~90% gets burned doesn't mean that the fair market value is actually 10 gwei and everyone else is overpaying by 90 gwei. If you artificially reduce the basefee so that the cost is 10 gwei, then you'll just suffer the known consequences of price fixing. If anything the priority fee would then jump to 90 gwei and the miner would get it.

EIP1559 didn't change the market value of gas, it just overhauled the dynamic. Instead of miners getting that 100 gwei, the network gets it. It makes more sense this way, the network is offering blockspace, not the miners. The miners are basically ""employees"" providing security to the network and getting compensated for it with the reward of 2 ETH every block they mine.

In order for proof of stake to work, there must be some value accrued to the token on the base chain.

It makes your fund highly illiquid, requires nearly 100% uptime, all the bandwidth/storage costs of running a node, and gets you a much bigger exposure to the inherent risks of the network (can't pull out your money as easily if something goes wrong). This is a non-negligible cost, especially given the very high minimum amount of funds required to stake. 

>no reason to give any control 

what control?? There is no on-chain governance. You don't get to control much as a validator. It's not an active ""i have money therefore all the power to change the rules"" scheme, it's more of a passive ""i have money, i put it up as a stake to show i won't mess with anything so that I dont get it slashed"". The most you can do as a validator is censor transactions, and even then it's pretty rare for any given validator to get selected for a block proposal. With proposer/builder separation this control will be mitigated even more.

IRRELEVANT TINY COST. you can have just part of your funds stake, in fact pos lets you sell part of coins from reward while still being able to grow % control you have at same time. and the key here is unforgeable costs that automatically adjust to make sure costs are as large as rewards, not some miniscule costs of having uptime. that's nothing compared to billions of dollars in rewards and completely free 72 million eth premine just for 1 party.

\> what control??

making blocks, mev, censorship

and just like with any blockchain, incentives control blockchains so they get to change rules ona whim including who owns what allowing confiscations, dilutions, and so on like the imbeciles of ethereum foundation have already done

\>  it's pretty rare for any given validator to get selected for a block proposal

rare lol. with 72 mil free central eth split between easily sybil'able millions of nodes you can run you can ensure you'll be selected way more than any outsider. censoring users is literally what makes it a 100% permissioned system as we ALWAYS knew about pos and fact stake has owners.

That's why its so important PoW depends on an external resource like matter/energy that's permissionless and makes it unforgeably costly on top of that to take away all incentive to control and why PoS has always been just something that requires infinite illiteracy on this topic. PoS is ""secure"" in same way a database is secure, and that has nothing to do with permissionless protocols.

and there's also ability to selectively devalue incentives/incentives for particiapnts in any soft/hard forks of the blockchain via external markets that ethereum foundation has literally done before to control eth that remains in any consensus system [https://medium.com/@WhalePanda/ethereum-chain-of-liars-thieves-b04aaa0762cb#.66xdzc8nd](https://medium.com/@WhalePanda/ethereum-chain-of-liars-thieves-b04aaa0762cb#.66xdzc8nd)

\> okay you're one of those people

yes, one of the people that actually knows this subject matter so basically like everyone outside of premine scam communities.

Have fun proving all of basic math wrong as that's the premise that is needed to claim ethereum has ever been decentralized.

Giving yourself a dollar is free: -1 + 1 = 0

premine is a central point of control with 1 party having more control everyone else can have combined w/o central permission: 72m/supply > (supply - 72m)/supply

1 central party in control is not 2+ parties in control: 1 < 2+

You can audit it yourself just fine. They can't magically print themselves more coins without breaking consensus rules, and they can't hide coins that haven't had an appropriate state transition. This is literally why all the initial transactions are all there in the genesis block: https://etherscan.io/block/0

>IRRELEVANT TINY COST

Exactly! Much tinier costs for the same economic security (if not more) as PoW. Win win for energy usage globally, and win win for the minimum viable issuance which is why it will drop drastically post-merge. But once the supply shock happens you will switch from calling the merge ""a false promise who will never happen, from devs who constantly never delivery"" (or whatever) to ""a coordinated gimmick with no other goal than to pump the price"". 

>making blocks, mev, censorship

Oh okay so exactly the same control miners have today then. Better make it so the control goes toward someone with an actual *stake* in the network, no? Rather than someone who just wastes energy to win a hash lottery and then sell the coins for a profit. Why let people extract value like that?

>with 72 mil free central eth split 

You're delusional. There's less than 9 million staked, and the staking cap will likely be around 30 million. The ethereum foundation does NOT own 72 million Ether. Your math is all fucked up lmao

Polkadot's main offering is security - every chain using the same security so there's no hiccups in how chains communicate / transact with each other but that takes away sovereignty as you can't really customize your chain to a degree that may be required and adds a risk of complete network exploitation should a vulnerability be found - that's the risk of having a single point of failure. Developers are forced into Polkadots framework and the $DOT token or they simply can't build on it - but if you do, you don't have to worry about security. Polkadots network is currently also a lot more expensive than Cosmos if you look at fees, staking requirements etc.   

Cosmos's main offering is sovereignty and customization - you are given a Cosmos SDK and you can build w/e chain you want with it, with an ability to customize various modules to your liking or your chain needs. Cosmos will also offer Interchain security but unlike Polkadot, no one will be forced into using it - projects can build their own validator networks if they like. The same with $ATOM token, you are not forced to use it to utilize the Cosmos network - in contrast to $DOT. There's some baseline requirements that a chain must meet to connect to the Interchain and it remains to be seen if they are sufficient security wise for the network to continue healthy functioning - so far there hasn't been any problems or exploits. It is also much cheaper to utilize Cosmos to chase yields on the network, staking, etc. 

Gavin Wood sees Cosmos as competition these days (few years ago he saw it as complimentary) as Cosmos's 'Internet of chains' or as it's called 'IBC' went live earlier last year and has been growing with prominent chains connecting to it:

https://mapofzones.com/?testnet=false&period=24&tableOrderBy=totalIbcTxs&tableOrderSort=desc

746,CryptoTechnology,ELI5 Interoperability: cosmos vs polkadot,yasserius,1641720114.0,133,87,0.98,"Polkadot is kind of a Unity for blockchains, it gives you a standardized SDK (Substrate) with which you build blockchains without the hassle of setting up bridges between them or having to worry about spinning up your own validators. But the bigger value is from the pre-built modules.

For projects it essentially turns developing a blockchain into the functional equivalent of developing a smart contract dApp on Ethereum. Only you get a lot more customizability because you have control over many of the underlying systems, e.g. which token to use for gas fees, who pays for gas and how, what kind of features the blockchain has natively etc.

An underrated benefit is that Polkadot gives you clout and distribution. If you're parachain you get a ton of marketing and BD exposure, kind of similar to an app store. Imho the validator thingy is not as relevant, even if Polkadot marketing loves to rave about it. You still need to work on getting collators and paying them, so the burden is similar.

Cosmos is bit more lower level than Polkadot, but very similar. It's a bit harder to give a game dev analogy, I guess it's kind of like using an Xbox/PS SDK? In that you're given the basic tools but you still need to work on your own modules for most things. 

Cosmos is definitely much more confederated than Polkadot. You'll notice that the success of LUNA or OSMO had virtually no impact on ATOM. Part of it is non-existent tokenomics, but it also reflects the fundamental separation between the Cosmos blockchains.

* Ethereum started as a single chain, and is aiming to build many additional sub-chains (rollups) that all share the same security and are interoperable
* Cosmos is currently an ecosystem of many independent blockchains, and is aiming to add shared security and interoperability (through IBC)
* Polkadot aims to launch with independent, interoperable chains with shared security

You can see that they all have the same goals, but some have opted to launch earlier and add features later, while others have opted to build a complete project before launching.

IMO, they all have the right goals, it's just a question of who can execute best. Ethereum has massive network effects, but it's more challenging to build rollups on top of an existing chain. Polkadot has a very comprehensive design, but the fact that it's taken them so long to start rolling out Parachains means other projects have attracted more marketshare.

 I don't think a development team will choose between them, for the team it will be pretty obvious what they want. Most new teams and some existing teams will pick Polkadot because they can focus on adding value to the users without worrying how much CPU they will need in 5 years and buying a server (analogy to AWS/Azure) and the existing teams who already have a chain and need to pivot to an ecosystem will probably choose Cosmos because they can replicate with a finer granularity their already built security mechanism (analogy to SDK)

The problem is, a value store that routinely loses 60% of its value in a few months *is a shit store of value*, and if you're actually trying to make money off of it, your first priority should be plugging that enormous leak. HODLing is genuinely a crap strategy.",1642623181.0,3

I'll add something to make it more relevant. Everyone is sure that `their own crypto investment` will bounce back strong at some point.

1. In regards to crypto as a general, I think many people simply understand that `applied decentralized logic` will become a huge part of humanity in some point.
2. Then there are a lot of people that just see the investment side of it, and they just hope their tokens bounces. These people will say whatever to pump their hopes and are more similar to people betting on things or too deep into pyramid schemes.
3. And lastly, there's people that think their own crypto projecst are the best suited for a specific use case, and that they will always bounce back or grow constantly, which is most likely not true for most. I myself think Polkadot and it's ecosystem is the sure winner on layer0 blockchains, and while I try to make this decision objectively, I might be completely wrong

Right now, the value of crypto is solely in its connection to fiat currency. You can buy a pizza with crypto but the only way someone knows how much a pizza costs in BTC is by some quick math against the current price. You could get paid in crypto, but the number of coins per month is going to fluctuate with the cost of whichever coin. No company is going to pay a flat coin rate right now because it could cost them 1k/month or 40k/month with the extreme volatility.

The volatility is a bug, not a feature, and it is the number one reason that more crypto exchange does not happen. And in conjunction with that, as more crypto exchange does happen, the value will become more stable, leading to less wild swings (and thus less overnight millionaires). 

Basically, crypto is not a safe investment, and don’t treat it as such. You’re not on the ground floor of something big. Don’t spend what you can’t afford lose. But there will probably be a lot more pumps along the way and someone will tell me how wrong I was, and that’s fine.

Reality is that crypto, among basically every other risk asset class rn, is heavily over-extended due to massive amounts of leverage inflows to the system due to the pandemic shifting assets.

This means that even when the price dumps, people who've held Bitcoin for longer will not sell, because they've seen it all before. Meanwhile, people who bought Bitcoin recently will sell.

When new money comes into Bitcoin for the first time, it will want to do so because the price is considered low in comparison with past performance, and there is an expectation of a price hike. When Bitcoin is bought, it takes some of the available Bitcoin out of circulation. Then supply and demand pushes the price up. As the price goes up again, FOMO will kick in. Dumb money will buy Bitcoin and push it even higher, and then the dumb money will panic again when it drops again. But not everyone will be selling. Those who held the longest are up the most, and so on. Those who sell at a loss will see their mistake and the next time they buy Bitcoin, they will hold.

Commercial: Bitcoin is treated as a risk-on asset, and portfolio managers want some exposure to it (maybe up to 2%) because it fits into modern portfolio theory. To do this, they have to either buy Bitcoin or a derivative of Bitcoin. This pushes up the price. However, when things are down (stocks, bonds, commodities and real estate) they will shake their Bitcoin to balance the books or meet margin requirements.

I only mentioned Bitcoin here, because everything is led by Bitcoin. Almost every other crypto is bought as a speculative thing, in the expectation it can rise faster than Bitcoin when Bitcoin is on the move again.",1642611376.0,2

First thing is don’t feel bad about feeling things like this. As most of the market does. 

The answer to your question is a extremely confident yes. Honestly, I haven’t been following market sentiment because I don’t care. (I am
Going to make a general statement)
Unfortunately, it’s a phycology game. I really hate the truth to this, but the last wave of new investors has been the largest yet. Inexperience combined with the fact that retail investors just don’t have the right understanding when compared to the big money. 

Imagine all of crypto was once owned by “people”. After years of big players/ institutions/ banks and governments they took notice in early 2021. It became clear crypto would be here to stay, and with crypto there is a long line of fundamentals that threaten their current lifestyle. Nothing they did couldn’t derail the now accepted inevitable conclusion that. A digital currency like crypto paired with blockchain technology is the future no doubt about it. This forced big money to adjusted their tactics. If you can’t beet them join them, and with a long term goal of owning it all. This is the last way they can keep writing the world financial narrative. Think back to 2021. This was the season of adoption. Nobody wanted in the game until it became clear control it by owning it. 

Some might would say “wouldn’t they take their millions and billions, and buy up everything all the available BTC ETH etc… and that is “retail think” but they wouldn’t do that Bc that is STUPID. Big money has a thing about not over payingIf all these companies started buying up all the available market holding think how fast BTC would have gone to 60k 100k 500k. That would be automatic on day one and would make a shit tone of retails multi millionaires. So scratch that. If the goal is to own the most it would be wiser to buy it off retail. The guarantee way to buy it off retail is dips and crashes. Regular folks feel the pressure and the big folks take it in. Guess how much of the market (BTC ETH) will be owned by them on the last mined coin. Could be in the 90%. All along retail was played. This is the game and we risk losing it all. Something meant for a great purpose to be all things to all people, and unless you saw this nobody will know it was stolen right out from under us, mostly Bc people can’t see past the opiate of the world.",1642624953.0,2

Bitcoin will, 100%. 

**Explanation:**

Bitcoin's block reward halves approximately every 4 years. The only way for mining to remain profitable is by its FIAT price at least doubling, given a fixed amount of miners. If this doesn't happen, nobody will mine Bitcoin, i.e. nobody will verify transactions, and the project will fail.

So, if we **assume** that Bitcoin will still be around in the future, there's a 100% chance that it will grow in value. Basically, the ""bet"" is on Bitcoin still being a thing. Price appreciation is a guarantee if that's true.

Note: this is not the case for proof-of-stake coins, although I can see some of the top 50 projects still being around and appreciate in price. However, this is speculation and not certainty, as it's the case for Bitcoin.",1642582657.0,6

Long term in comes down to the service that this solution provides. If you don't believe in that blockchain is a good solution to the problem it claims to solve, then you believe it will at one point in the future be worthless. We are now in a hype/ bubble/...

However most people here believe that crypto efficiently solved some of the world's largest problem such as a currency. If that is true, and nobody comes up with a better solution, the asset will increase in value and thus, in price. 

Bitcoin is replacing gold. So as said in the previous paragraph, gold might have been the best way to solve a use case (storing wealth). Gold will likely lose value if we have a better solution which is btc. Maybe in 30 years we come with a better alternative and BTC loses value.

Let me add another data point.  I work in the technology industry and have a number of large financial institutions as clients.  In the last 12-18 months I've seen large banks and investment managers:

* building the needed back-end systems and processes so that they can begin offering crypto to high-net-worth clients
* training their investment advisors on crypto-products which initially will be ETFs, but given the investment above will surely also include direct investment in tokens, etc. 

So we can expect the thousands of wealth advisors that work for these firms to be offering crypto into portfolios for high net worth and other advisor clients.  

In other words, the ""mainstream"" adoption of crypto is still in the early stages which suggests that there will be more organic demand across the market.  Just like the stock market there will be winners and losers, but this should be positive overall.

Even if you are very confident in crypto, you need to be realistic. It could all go to shit for various reasons we can't even imagine right now.

I feel BTC dominance can be a comparable indicator of this, but you have to keep in mind its relevancy. BTC dominance can go down while BTC is being accumulated, if people are moving money through BTC into other tokens. But as long as BTC dominance is sustaining key levels, there's no reason to believe people are moving away from BTC. 

The reason people don't believe in the bubble as much is because supply is limited, and will always be limited. So it's a supply and demand war that moves price up. It's abandonment of the asset that moves price down. And since institutional money is playing a game of accumulation, there's not a lot of reason for people to give up on BTC. Personally I believe over time, we will see people move into the crypto space and slowly diversify away from BTC, while in many ways still accumulate it. For instance index funds may include BTC down the line, and people will keep propping the price up that way. Some cryptos are heavily vested in BTC. Etc.

Also you missed a step where Crypto is ultimately also pegged to USD, because when people talk about drops in the market they're not talking about the value in BTC, they're talking about the value in USD. No one cares if the number of BTC their ETH is worth halved if the value of BTC in USD doubled.

Also the reason that traditional investment markets enjoy relative stability is because they're regulated and the things that are being invested in have intrinsic value, which limits the extent of price swings overall. Companies have assets and revenue streams, and stocks pay out dividends and other benefits on top of their value as speculative investments. This limits a lot of the swings independent of whatever currency is being traded for the stock, because the ""expected value"" of these investments is fairly well understood from past behavior, and the investments are backed up by intrinsic value.

For a very basic example, if you buy orange futures then when the crop comes in you own a bunch of oranges, and someone somewhere is going to want to buy those to turn them into things or sell them to consumers, so they have intrinsic value.

Crypto doesn't have any intrinsic value at present. The value is entirely based on whatever people are willing to buy or sell it at, and that's based largely on confidence in the future price. There's nothing backing up the value, so the market ends up inherently volatile.",1642614419.0,2

For example there's no technical limitation preventing anyone from setting up a block-chain and just paying for compute time in USD, no crypto currency required. There are a bunch of practical reasons that no one's going to do that right now, not least of which because setting up a new crypto currency is a lot more profitable, and you don't need any actual money to ""pay"" people in your made-up crypto token, but there's nothing about ""block chain"" that requires a currency.

Because of this these currencies don't actually have any intrinsic value in and of themselves. I can't do anything with a crypto currency token besides exchange it for ""fiat"" currency or, very occasionally, a product or service directly. In comparison I can eat a potato, or if I own stock in a company I might be entitled to some of that company's assets if they go bankrupt.

Crypto is often compared to gold in terms of the market speculation and the sort of people who invest in it, but gold also goes through boom and bust cycles based on speculation, however gold is still a useful material with a measurable demand in manufacturing and other activities, so there's a minimum level the price of gold can actually drop to based on that demand.

You could say that most currencies also have no intrinsic value, and that would be roughly correct, except that because of how the world economy is structured the value of a currency is tied to the strength of a country's economy. As long as the US Dollar is legal tender in the United States by law then there will be demand for US dollars from people and companies that want to buy things in the United States. This is why the value of the British Pound dropped after Brexit, suddenly it was harder and more expensive to buy things from Britain, so people and firms looked elsewhere for those purchases and therefor the value of the British Pound dropped.

Crypto currencies don't have anything like that backing them up. There's some theoretical value in block chain technologies, but a lot of the problems that it purports to solve are either already solved by other means that are, at least right now, better, or they're not practical problems or ones that exist without block chain and crypto in the first place. Even NFTs are more of a weird investment product mixed with an even weirder, and legally questionable, art movement. The few real world applications I've seen or heard of for block chain technology are being leveraged privately, generally to do with verification of records or transactions, and aren't using public blockchains or technology.

Hope that makes sense, it got kinda long and wordy. The gist is that there isn't really any inherent value in Crypto Currencies or public Block Chain right now, just a lot of theories, often from people who don't understand the ""problems"" they're talking about solving.",1642627685.0,2

Not really seeing where you're coming from here.

The US government has rules on how it manages currency, as do most developed nations, but that has very little to do with ""intrinsic value"". You can deflate or inflate the value of something by restricting or adding to the supply of that thing, but that's not the same thing as intrinsic value.

To make a somewhat ridiculous example, because any realistic one is going to be polarizing...

If someone made a piece of art that gave anyone who looked at it a headache and nausea, that art might have a high agreed upon value, but would have no intrinsic value because it's not actually useful for anything. It's not even suitable for general public display because of the effects. If the original artist made more of that piece the value of the first one might drop, but the lack of intrinsic value wouldn't change.

In contrast diamond has an intrinsic value because it has uses beyond its agreed upon social desirability and artificially induced rarity. Raw diamond is used in industrial settings and is an ingredient in various manufactured goods. The intrinsic value of diamond is much lower than its perceived or agreed upon value, which is why industrial diamonds with no aesthetic value are incredibly cheap compared to ""gem quality"" diamonds, but there's still an intrinsic value that would remain even if everyone in the world suddenly lost their desire for shiny objects, or diamonds became unfashionable through some societal shift.

None of that applies to crypto coins, NFTs, or any of the other mass market crypto uses currently in existence. All of their value is societal. They only have value because people are willing to pay money, in other currencies, for them. Even things like NFTs don't have any real utility right now that isn't easier and cheaper to replicate with some other piece of technology. There's a lot that's been said about the ""value"" of a chain of ownership in digital mediums, but that's questionable even on a societal level right now, when I can go on Deviant Art and buy a digital copy of a work directly from the creator and be fairly sure that the creator is the one getting my money. If I go on an NFT marketplace there's a decent chance that any given piece of art is pirated.

Within the context of a game there's no practical difference at present between an ""NFT Item"" and any other item, since the game company still controls the game and my data and thus who can own or receive the item.

In short ""potential value"" is another way of saying ""societal value"" but with a big ""maybe"" attached.

Also intrinsic value is not the same thing as utility. Crypto currencies have a lot of theoretical utility (aka, ability to and convenience of using them), but in practice right now they have a lot less than ""fiat"" currencies. That's not the same as them having intrinsic value though.",1642634176.0,3

But the thing is that this  bank has taken nearly a month to announce that it will return the stolen funds, and they dared to call it a ""goodwill payout"" - they're returning the money not because it's the right thing to do, but out of the ""kindness"" of their ""hearts"". (And because the Monetary Authority of Singapore is breathing down their neck).

Victims even have to sign an NDA not to reveal the details of the money returned.

People are still slamming the bank for their very poor response to this incident.

They are putting everything together with an investigation and will be releasing a statement to their blog in the next few days like A REAL COMPANY.

I don’t think they were in any way trying to shove anything under the rug. They had an immaterial amount stolen and everyone was reimbursed, so they are correct in saying this did not result in a loss of customer funds. I think some people are stuck on the way it is being described, some think that there WAS a loss of customer funds, and that the company is just reimbursing for lost funds, but I think the CEOs main concern is whether or not a customer will have lost funds in the end of the day, and no they will not, because they have already been reimbursed for any lost funds, so no customer is ultimately affected. 

Can you imagine Coinbase dealing with this? I think they already did, and people are being hacked all the time on that service and they refuse to do anything to mitigate the losses, the even come after their own customers when they create a situation where a hacker can drain even their fiat bank account and move the funds off Coinbase in a matter of minutes… zero look into a better way to do it so that doesn’t happen…",1642626872.0,1

You seem to have the notion that off-chain computation somehow makes the blockchain more centralized, and that that has to do with why Cardano won't scale. Rather, the opposite is in effect. Here's an explanation of how Cardano works at the Plutus core development level:

Each smart contract performs some operations on the Cardano Computation Layer (CCL) and the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL); the former is where the actual transactions get done, whereas the latter is purely for validation and settlement. The idea is that, in a smart contract, the code for validation should be known to all counterparties; this way, the computation can optionally be known, and potentially even done by a bad actor, but you'll still have the assurance that the code for the validation of a transaction will securely and incorruptibly go through.

This is what makes Cardano so fundamentally scalable; only the validation has to actually happen ""on-chain"", however the computation can happen on L2s or sidechains or pretty much anywhere. In addition, optimizing to this effect is what Basho is all about, and you're going to see more to this effect in 2022 and beyond.

We can get into details about the specific possible range of `maxTxSize` and `maxBlockBodySize`, but I don't think there's any point if we disagree on the fundamentals about how distributed ledgers work, when/where they face race conditions, and how they can become scalable.

Considering that it's completely new building on eUTXO. The first really usable ethereum dAPP took around 1,5 years or so too if I am not mistaken.

Now the DOT team is working towards true decentralization (although arguably they are already the most decentralized because every token holder gets to vote in how the protocol is developed). 

Meanwhile both IOHK and SundaeSwap have felt the need to release statements basically warning users about “long delays or failed transaction” just because one DEX is trying to launch on ADAs blockchain..

Edit: a lot of people have messages me saying that ADA has more use cases than Polkadot because it is trying to secure partnerships with small African countries that do absolutely nothing for the token price…. So I guess I’ll just have to remind you that T-Systems (AKA T-Fuckin-Mobile) bought a “significant amount” of DOT to participate in the network and build out their infrastructure. https://www.telekom.com/en/media/media-information/archive/t-systems-mms-supports-polkadot-blockchain-ecosystem--643644",1642602908.0,44

That's 47x slower than a native UTXO on Cardano, 100x slower than an Ethereum tx, and 66,000x slower than a Cosmos and Terra tx. 0.15 TPS is a max of 12,960 txs per day, under ideal conditions... on the entire Cardano chain.

Cardano can scale with sidechains, but it will likely take years to do that correctly. That's why they're pushing M1 instead.

The issue is that there are several off-chain vulnerabilities that can't be detected on-chain. Thats actually the point of going off-chain. If the off-chain code is open source and decentralized (and that's the hard part) these vulnerabilities will exist. Ownerless SCs is a problem that is frivolously easy for accounts models.

Sidechains or RUs are really Cardano's only scaling options right now. Otherwise they will end up having the exact same throughput problems as Ethereum L1

Cardano L1 has never been designed to be fast. The way Cardano interacts with L2’s like Hydra is done differently to the way Ethereum does it. With Ethereum, L2’s are a separate ledger to L1, therefore congestion is introduced when funds bounce from one ledger to another. Cardano later 2’s operate on the same ledger, therefore they are faster and better and more secure.  

OP as usual misunderstands the way Cardano slots together quite nicely and instead chooses little chinks in the armour to wedge his knife into, ignoring that they are known weaknesses, specced since white paper days and fixes are already working.  

He complains about smart contract usage, and then in the same breath complains that there isn’t enough scaling. Well, what do you want them to do? If they held back all SC deployment until the chain was fully scalable then that’s even less SC usage. If they released all SC stuff a year ago the chain wouldn’t be scalable and you’d end up with something that works different to ETH but suffers all the same problems.

In traditional UTxO inputs must be spent, so you can't reference a UTxO as an input without consuming it.

Cardano includes scripts in the UTxO.
Since you can't reference another UTxO, you need to include the script, which means more data, and in turn larger script transactions and therefore less script transactions fit in a block.

CIP-0033 will allow an input to be a reference to a script UTxO meaning the same script on the chain can be reused and doesn't take up so much data, so in turn smaller transactions therefore more script transactions per block.

But yes agree. Trying to balance research with real world development isn’t easy and there are benefits to both approaches in terms of whether the academics or the engineers lead the way. 

The question is the culture of the team, whether they call out existential problems or issues as they become clear - or just coast into an ice berg, Theranos like, because people are too scared to speak up that the research isn’t delivering as expected.

So I'm doing my best to sift through the layers of bullshit on this sub but I have a non-technical understanding of crypto. I know what it is and the theory of how it works but not a technical basis to understand it on a deeper level. So my point is, this English is not plain enough for me to understand fully and I'd like to fix that. For example OP says: 

>What makes Cardano fundamentally slower than every other chain is how bloated their tx sizes are. We've all heard the sales pitch ""And Cardano has native tokens that don't need smart contracts!,"" but what you didn't get told is that native UTXO txs on Cardano are an average of 500 bytes WITHOUT smart contracts. And that a basic, native tx is larger than the average Ethereum tx WITH smart contracts.

It seems like ADA stores smart contracts in a fundamentally different organizational level from other chains which affects the transfer size? I'd like to understand more of the technical aspects of crypto better.  Txs, UTXO, factors that affect transfer speeds and node requirements, etc. The technical metrics and building blocks that define how a blockchain operates. 

Do you know of a resource that explains some of those so I can better understand?",1642616216.0,7

There is some truth to the fack that market makers having liquidity is a good thing, so there can be a small case to be made that responsible levels of borrowing and shorting can help markets.

However, we don't want to allow what is currently happening in traditional markets to happen in crypto. Like the paper gold and silver markets, or the rampant naked shorting with meme stocks.

I think one of the issues is that crypto users are very interested in earning yield on their holdings. This allow centralized services and exchanges to hold a lot of liquidity, in turn leading to less risk when engaging in market manipulation.

I follow monero closely and it's a pretty hot topic the idea that exchanges are artificially suppressing the price of XMR. It seems too coincidental that certain exchanges turn off the withdrawal option whenever the price moves up quickly. There was a $25 price difference between Kraken and another exchange not so long ago, but arbitrage was very difficult because you couldn't remove any XMR from the other exchange. Moneros privacy might be more conducive for hiding price suppression, but I think it can happen to any token on a CEX really.

While centralized exchanges will always have their purpose, I do think it's incredibly important for the broader crypto community to adopt and use decentralized solutions. This will make price suppression harder and aid in price discovery that more accurately reflects the true market price.

That is why I'm personally really excited about atomic swaps between BTC-XMR, and soon ETH-XMR. I'm also really excited watching ThorChain progress, a cross chain dex that supports native chains.

These solutions will allow trading, yield generation, and arbitrage in a decentralized way taking a lot of power away from centralized providers.",1642627362.0,2

And sadly, these notions - while lacking nuance and accuracy - are hardly unwarranted.

Not to mention the cryptocurrency community has an at least somewhat well-deserved negative reputation.

However, it’s also not true that all this hardware can be repurposed. You see, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are just that. Application specific. There’s absolutely nothing you can do with 4 hashboards and a motherboard as a meaningful piece of hardware in cloud computing, unless you’re plugging them in to a data center to mine cryptocurrency. 

Also idk that the networking part of this post is true, when it comes to data-centers it is the most efficient use of energy possible in computing. If we didn’t have them, everybody and their mother would all need to own a server rack themselves, so regardless if we want the internet to stay alive, the hardware needs to exist. And it’s more efficient existing in a data center than decentralized across everybody’s home. 

But with all that said, the energy produced still sounds accurate, the difference is most people can’t live without the internet, and most people can live without crypto. 

I think the real energy competitor to crypto should be fiat itself. How much energy does it cost to secure the USD? Well it requires a nation with borders, and an army. Literally every person living in the US, working in the US, serving overseas under a US flag, all the transportation we use, the 300+ military bases around the world, the infrastructure itself, *ALL OF IT* is what secures the USD. Which is literally thousands fold what btc takes to secure itself.

This is a genuine question, how do they make a PoW system that uses less electricity?

Basically, the power requirement should be a function of the value of the reward mining a block. For example if you receive the equivalent of $10 for mining a block, you would be willing to spend up to $10 of electricity to mine it (as other people are fighting to be the first, the amount of electricity used will approach close to this limit). If on the other hand you were to receive the equivalent $100,000 for mining a block, that is how much electricity you would be willing to use.

The increase in electricity use is done by increasing the number of mining units you run.

If somehow you were able to get the equivalent of $100,000 to mine a block but it only took $10, of electricity, would just increase the amount of people who would try to mine it. These people would then compete with each other to be the first by increasing their power consumption.

Vitalik himself said a selfish part of why ethereum needs to move to PoS is because instead of paying out miners millions of dollars per month it’ll be closer to a couple million a year on PoS.

The only competitor appears to be PoS - a system that favors entities with a higher amount of tokens, above those with lower amounts.

So a more substantial stakeholder grows faster than a small stakeholder. At a certain point, the cost of being part of the mining operation would start to be too high, causing small stakeholders to drop out, causing centralization.

The analog is that the PoW system favors entities with a higher amount of hash rate over those with a lower amount.  Meaning, that more substantial hash rate providers end up with larger profit margins.

Where the analog breaks down is that PoW miners have no incentive to hold coins or secure the network beyond the last block.  They can dump as soon as they 'earn' a coin and if they find themselves an opportunity to double-spend or conduct a 51% attack, they are financially incentivized to do so.  

Whereas PoS holders and delegators would risk their entire investment if they allowed that to happen so they are financially incentivized to never allow or conduct any monkey business.  

The optimal model is [Open Representative Voting](https://senatusspqr.medium.com/why-99-of-cryptocurrencies-centralize-over-time-and-how-it-might-affect-your-investment-6623936b664) which can only be run on L1 coins with no supply inflation and doesn't incentivize centralization like PoW and PoS.",1642613276.0,1

Depends on how you view the origin of the word ""octopus"". There's debate as to whether it came from Greek or Latin. If it came from Latin, ""octopi"" would be the correct plural. If it came from Greek, ""octopods"" or ""octopodes"" would be correct.

If you dress it up in English clothes, then ""octopuses"" would be correct.

That post has more info about the wallet including tracking a transfer from the previous cold storage to a hot storage then to a user withdrawal who was participating in the alpha wallet release of RH wallets -

 Essentially they said “we don’t own a sizable portion in any of our crypto assets”. Which was taken as RH doesn’t own crypto but the fact is they are in custody of it and - their users own it. It’s a semantic statement that is “technically correct”.

Also last I tracked the wallet(s) they own multiple they had about 30% off Doge which just means their users went ham for Doge when it was cheap and during the buildup.

Edit: [RH users are still accumulating it’s up to nearly 31%](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/wallet/3334959)",1642546216.0,35

Tenev said ""we don’t have significant positions in any of the coins we keep"". This means that Robinhood doesn't invest company funds in crypto. That isn't a surprise at all - they shouldn't be investing company funds in such risky assets anyway. The journalist who wrote that article you quoted doesn't understand the meaning of the term ""position"", and IIRC he admitted on Twitter that he got this wrong.

Tenev is not saying that Robinhood isn't in possession of crypto. The whole point of Robinhood is that they keep the crypto in custody for their customers, and they claim to hold crypto that covers all the holdings of their customers. If Tenev had actually denied this, it would have been a massive scandal and would have taken down Robinhood.

So Robinhood has enough Doge, Bitcoin etc to cover the holdings of their customers. They don't have a substantial position in crypto beyond that.",1642560368.0,2

I don't think this was correct about rug-pulls and of course Dogecoin isn't a new cryptocurrency. There's no real threat here. OP is confusing the threat of rug-pulls from new cryptocurencies who have large pre-mines/insta-mines.

The large accumulation isn't the greatest, but the worst it could cause, is a large price drop if it dumped quickly. Since most of that wallet's coins were bought at almost double today's value, that seems only a good way for the holder to lose big-time money.

It's obvious this account isn't a single person. There are very many structured in and out transactions.

This address holds an amount about equal Dogecoin's top daily transaction amount, which is about 4 times it's more standard daily transaction amount.

Dogecoin doesn't just sit in wallets, it's always moving. This wallet's coins are steadily churning as well.

I think it might be illuminating that the wallet tries to maintain a liquidity of the top daily transfers. That's something a large broker or exchange might do.",1642617456.0,2

That post has more info about the wallet including tracking a transfer from the previous cold storage #1 to a hot storage #1 then to a users withdrawal who was participating in the alpha wallet release of RH wallets -

Essentially they said “we don’t own a sizable portion in any of our crypto assets”. Which was taken as RH doesn’t own crypto but the fact is they are in custody of it and - their users own it. It’s a semantic statement that is “technically correct”.

Also last I tracked the wallet(s) (they own multiple) had about 30% of Doge which just means their users went ham for Doge when it was cheap and during the buildup.

It doesnt matter who the wallet owner is, basically if it is anything other than an institutional player like a CEX, there's the potential for one person to cash out and crash out. And the evidence seems to suggest that it isn't an institution.

I would be looking at when the wallet last moved. If it has been making transactions and isn't a dead wallet someone forgot, then you'd have to ask why they haven't already pulled. Either this is only one of their market positions, or they don't want to sell, or they are waiting for the next pump but missed the previous one.

I would say the real issue here is that if doge ever reaches a new ATH, this wallet will dump. It's already fuck you money. But you'd want to look at how it moved before and what it did during the craze last spring. If it isn't selling today, it probably won't sell tomorrow.

Everyone learns at their own pace, everyone is capable of executing new praxis at different paces etc, but we should be creeping towards self custody.

It also doesn't have to be one or the other. If you don't trust yourself to manage your own keys then just try it out with a small sum. If you screw up the bulk of your crypto is still safe on the CEX, if the CEX gets hacked then at least you still have some in your wallet. Splitting it 50/50 isn't even a terrible idea.

Leaving crypto on exchanges is in discord with the ethos of crypto for two reasons. Firstly, bitcoin was created to take power back from banks. We all got lazy, we all just wanted mister bank to keep our money safe and while we were sleeping soundly in our beds knowing our money was secure we got fleeced. Banks amassed so much power they were free to just do whatever they want, and we let them. Leaving all the capital on a CEX will begin to afford them the same opportunities.

And secondly, cryptos finite supply is a huge part of it's price. Taking your coins off the exchange reduces the supply which adds fuel for upward price action. Why wouldn't you want to do everything you can to add bullish support for where you've risked your money. Leaving it on exchanges or even lending it to the blockfi's and celsius who lend it to shorters is like sending your money into battle then sending supplies to the enemy.",1642617951.0,2

Mining entities compete by utilizing the most powerful ASIC equipment. The higher the equipment’s hashing power, the more tries it can make to guess the hash target correctly and win the block reward.

Over the years, this has led to increasingly powerful and expensive miners being developed, to the point that Bitcoin mining is reserved chiefly for corporations with deep pockets.

The specs of Intel’s Bonanza chip aren’t known at this time. But being low energy, miners could benefit from lower electricity costs (thus greater profitability). And the consumption argument put forward by environmentalists would carry less weight.

But in the long-term, lower electricity mining costs may not make any difference. One Slashdot user commented that miners would produce more hashes, bringing zero net benefits regardless of electricity cost.”

PoW is designed to reward those with the cheapest energy costs.  Most people live in highly populated areas where energy costs are elevated.  Energy costs are cheapest in remote areas with stranded energy.  It's easier (and more cost efficient) for these low-cost energy producers to negotiate a single bulk contract with a well capitalized mining company that owns enough ASICs to consume all the excess energy.

That's not to say there's no room for retail miners - but, you would need to live somewhere remote with your own cheap energy supply (e.g. solar panels in a sunny location or a wind turbine in a windy location).",1642620131.0,4

The FDIC has some models and resources for doing that on a simple scale like you want to do. 

Across many banks, look at the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of a bank, along with the weightings used for those ratios from the official documentation. These ratios were designed to help measure a bank’s resilience to a bank run scenario based on a 2008-ish liquidity crisis. With the way the LCR is designed, no covered bank should run out of liquid funds within 30 days. And if liquidity gets so bad that banks are running out of funds, the central bank is certain to intervene with cash today.

Trying to predict a bank run is difficult, and if you are trying to build a trading algorithm based on that you have to consider: how stale is my deposits data for this bank going to be? At what point would the bank’s securities become price-sensitive to this fundamental condition? At the times where bank run risk matters, is this going to be a priced factor for just one bank or a systemic event that shocks all security prices?",1642342433.0,52

However, LCR only tells us the **minimum amount** required by law for a bank to keep at hand as liquid funds at any point in time. And, as you stated it is a constant ratio.

I am trying to build a statistical model that will predict the amount of funds to keep as liquid funds so that if the previous patterns of historical withdrawals and deposits were to continue, there would be a low probability that liquid funds would be exhausted. This, in fact would not account for a black swan bank run type scenario because in those cases, the withdrawal activity might spike, which will not be accounted for in the model.

Since all banks need to have a LCR > 100%, it’s a much higher threshold than the amount of funds needed to keep liquid for historical withdrawal rates. Because the LCR was designed based off of historical data, satisfying the LCR means the probability of a bank running out of funds based on *historical* withdrawal rates like you want to model will be zero.

Perhaps I don’t understand why you are going to the effort to model something we already know the answer to. Are you trying to use this to predict a bank failure? Do you want to trade bank equity with this model? How much effort do you want to put in to a model that doesn’t give you actionable information?

If you really want to understand this process and you still think it’s worth the effort, read Choudhury’s book The Principles of Banking, especially the chapters on ALM.

1. Cluster like with like data (i.e. similar new headlines, sec filings, etc.). This would involve some level of NLP in order to properly parse this data and find it's ""similarity score"" with other data --> look into search algorithms for help. Vector search is a good place to start if you are looking for a very technical solution.
2. Use survival analysis on each of the clustered categories from step 1. This will tell you how strong any given signal is and in general what the survival curve of each signal (clustered category) will look like. This step is very relevant if you are looking to parse news, as this data can be very difficult to separate the useful information from the noise. 
3. The final step is to try to find a lead-lag relationship between the modeled out data from step 2 and any underlying asset(s) you find are related to this data. 

For example, you can parse a bunch of pubic filings (10-Q, 8-K, Forms 3, 4, 5, etc.) for a particular stock (extra both numerical information as well as the language use in each filing) and see how the language changes in each filing relative to how the numbers of each file changes. Then try to find if this data has any relationship with the target underlying stock (i.e. a lead-lag relationship of sorts). That is how you can start doing ""quantamental"" analysis.

I would guess you could take many, many instances of companies releasing this info and assume all other factors produce some random noise around the price; then see if you can find a consistent signal pulse at the time of earnings release.

However, it is very possible market understanding changes in a non-random way overtime. Maybe in 1999 every earnings rallied +X% anyways regardless of misses; maybe in 2001 every earnings sold off regardless.

I’m just thinking out loud now, but maybe there is research in signal processing for finding a consistent signal under non-random noise. I’ll Google some and update with any interesting references I find.

Most of the systems created are about going long. Those have had an economic wind at their back... the market spends more time going up than going down. Create a long-biased system, throw darts at stock picks, and you'll find that the longs win over the shorts. They have to.

Systems that win for shorts are usually about identifying assets for which there is a reason to short. Crappy fundamentals in a stock. Sectors that are losers in the ever-turning economic cycle. Stocks going down have to do it long enough for the volatility skew to not eat the trade before you enter, which means you really need to identify a sustainable edge for the shorts. Hedge funds that do market-neutral strategies, that's what they are aiming for.

So yes, what you see is real. And it is older than likely any of us who trade in the market. Inverting to go short is a conceptual bias, it isn't an analysis of market behavior or security fundamentals that be exploited unless your system is designed to really be bidirectional.

I have producer threads for system inputs and one consumer thread.

Producers produce Quotes, Aggregates, Timeouts, RPC calls etc. These are all system inputs. They are placed on the consumer's threadsafe queue. This is pretty much a replication of asyncio, but I don't have to write async await everywhere and I don't have the mental overload of having to avoid mixing red/green functions.

Then I have a consumer (the main thread) which is of course blocking. This is good for debugging purposes. Once an event starts being consumed, the world stops so you know you can't have concurrency issues and you can do step by step debugging. The program doesn't jump all over the place.

If I have to handle an event in the main thread that requires CPU power, the first thing I try is to use one of the producers to calculate everything live. If that doesn't work, I use a multiprocess worker queue to offload the CPU work.

Edit:

Threadsafe Queues solve a lot of problems and avoid classes of bugs by virtue of existing.

For example: While using IB API, once IB disconnects for whatever reason, this event is sent to consumer's queue, consumer deallocates and reallocates the IB client and retries connecting cleanly. This way you avoid most locks and mutexes trying to make the IB thread clean up itself.

Queues also solve concurrency problems. You send/receive messages to/from your FIX Application in an orderly manner so that there is no chance of the first function call finishing after your second function call.",1642143599.0,23

While it might seem like a nightmare to debug a massively parallel system, that's only the case if you've included a lot of sychronization and blocking. A good parallel system is just executing the same stream of operations thousands or millions of times in parallel. So, if I see a log message that TSLA's stream had an exception, I can rerun the entire pipeline and set that as the single symbol being processed. I can then walk through the entire workflow in the same way you'd step through a single-process application. 

This is a similar approach to what you'd take for writing parallel code on the PS3 or your GPU and yes it does make things like look-back or cross-communications difficult. You end up having to structure your algorithms so that there's none of that, even if it means duplicating data into a process. You're trading memory for execution speed. This is definitely not the best approach for a beginner. I have a background in high performance and scalable computing so this makes sense.

If I was building smaller scale I'd probably work serially with as much async as possible but with the execution driven by an input that could be scaled (i.e., a really sleek single app with async calls that runs fast and the input is a list of symbols let's say). That way I could scale horizontally in the future by partitioning load by whatever the core dataset is (in this example, 1000 symbols per node or something). 

Scaling horizontally allows you to spawn a new node on your laptop, on a separate machine, or in the cloud that can all compute to their best ability without requiring that you rework any of your code or sychronize anything. Just spawn a node, give it symbols and a config, and boom it's off processing your algorithms and storing your results.

Storing results is always tricky once you scale out but that's a 5000 word post in and of itself -- NoSQL and eventual consistency can help out massively. I use key value stores and the threads insert into different partitions based on a symbol driven partitioning key scheme. That way, you get max throughput, inserting in-parallel and async, and avoid having multiple threads writing to the same partition.

Anyway, going off on a tangent, I could write all day about this, haha. Algo trading and the systems behind them are some of the most interesting, performant, and complex in the world.

5551,altcoin,Jacy looking juicy!,Monster1487,1642564131.0,16,23,0.77,"Thought I would take a stroll down shitcoin alley, its been a while.

I see nothing has changed, one webpage wonder that wont actually do anything useful until phase 4 ? and when is phase 4 ? I mean let's not confuse phases with quarters or was that the intention ? and if you keep going you can always kick that down the road, cant you ? Seen that tons of time and some app that has your webpage and ability to buy and see your balance is not an app. Where it the mock up of that ?

All this work, marketing, signing people up just for an NFT museum ?, in the scheme of things how hard is it to have built an NFT marketplace or have some kind of working model or part of one ?  and hey, I see you pumped and dumped once and its building back up or was that part of build up again ? Anyone who is passionate about something like this would have more than words.

and your contract ? it stunk before I gave it the smell test, better fixit up a little before certik looks at it: [https://tokensniffer.com/token/0x916c5de09cf63f6602d1e1793fb41f6437814a62](https://tokensniffer.com/token/0x916c5de09cf63f6602d1e1793fb41f6437814a62)

The interesting thing is that the new contracts stinks more then the old one:

0x08f2991a6eff2671cf791b82aeae64fbbfdd0633

[https://tokensniffer.com/token/0x08f2991a6eff2671cf791b82aeae64fbbfdd0633](https://tokensniffer.com/token/0x08f2991a6eff2671cf791b82aeae64fbbfdd0633)

Imagine that, you changed contracts because the other pumped and dumped ? Yet the new contract is full of rugpull holes.

So if you fix up the rugpull holes, Certik only audits the security and some possible code flaws but they dont verify what the program does, if its useful, if it actual does something. They passed a shit coin that was the equivalent of a metal cash box with a padlock on it.

Does anyone know what a white paper is anymore ? this has some vague pie in the sky ideas.

Your tokennomics is boilerplate from all the other shitcoins with reflections.

Where is your team doxed ? how about names and linked in profiles on the webpage ? What have they got to hide ?

Listing on CMC or coingeko means nothing, its no endorsement of anything, tons of shitcoins are listed.

But hey, dont worry, I have written emails like this before because I cared about people new to crypto getting ripped off. But I guess its greed that gets the better of them once they drank the kool-aid. 

I would be careful in your response,  I may never come back unless provoked. I poke my head in another shitcoin that managed to kick the can down the road 10 months and it still does nothing and people still believe. But because they jumped all over me, I made it a point of coming back once a month, today is that day, Shall I add you to the list ?",1642619544.0,3
