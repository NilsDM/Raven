I'll copy and paste a reply I wrote over in /r/Hedera regarding Hedera's overall business model (and roadmap, I guess), just cos ain't nobody got time rewriting. Last couple paragraphs are the relevant bit but the rest is context.

""Many enterprises prefer a private dag network at the core of their infrastructure and for areas where they simply do not need public consensus.

These are designed to be modular and interoperable - this is more akin to tradition databases but built on the same kind of technology. 

IBM offer a whole suite of modular services for enterprise use in this area, with Walmart and Land Rover being some of the notable users. 

Hashgraph is designed to interoperate with these networks seamlessly providing public consensus or other specific functions if needed. 

The information is immutably encoded with no single point of failure, this remains very valuable - the private networks are more databases where Hashgraph helps create the internet out of them and allows parties that wish to do so interact directly with each other's databases with absolute trust.

In order to achieve this, Hedera offer the HCS - the simple and seamless capability of using the consensus service and nothing else. This isn't limited to private networks, anyone can use it if they so desire, as long as they pay their fees. 

This is useful for many Hyperledger clients, and you'll notice a significant overlap when comparing them with Hedera ecosystem partners (Walmart are heavily involved in promoting a new universal standard for digital coupons built entirely on Hedera's Hashgraph for example)

They also offer the HTS - programmable tokens at the native layer with all the performance on offer from the Hashgraph Algorithm (these offer about 80% of the functionality of Smart Contracts according to Mance - the rest can obviously be covered by the EVM and competing projects - if needed they can absolutely develop a superior smart contract platform but Hyperledger is already taking a good part towards this so mutual value is found.

The idea of modular, interoperable, open source infrastructure building up web 3.0 is the whole idea. You don't achieve that when one project wins alone, Hedera nonetheless offers value to the other parties within the ecosystem - that's what we're all about right? Cut out inefficiency and utilise the value gained. Just maths.

This brings me to the Hedera Smart Contract Service 

Hedera themselves aim to fully integrate Hyperledger Besu, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in the coming weeks - allowing Ethereum based dApps to run within Hedera and interact seamlessly with the Hedera ecosystem.  

Once complete, all the Ethereum developers have to do is copy and paste their code into the virtual machine and suddenly their dApp is running perfectly yet with the ~300 TPS of Besu. Kind of a no brainer as we wait for Ethereum 2.0 - and once that is in place the EVM will be able to at least keep up with the open source product, and likely continue to outpace it in the long term.",1642685654.0,2

11,CryptoTechnology,An Interesting Development with Hedera - Hashgraph Patent to be made Open Source,Vandeleur1,1642613930.0,27,57,0.88,"Regarding fees I made a reply to someone the other day, keep in mind that once again this applies to Hedera (though Hashgraph has the same underlying capability to fix fees in a scalable networks):

""Enterprise use demands stability in price - you need to write up a budget including operating costs so that you can see whether engaging in that activity is viable for your business. You simply cannot do that with variable gas fees, certainly not those of Ethereum-  and even Polygon's offering has been demonstrated to be a long way off with even a relatively small transaction volume. 

Why would an enterprise adopt and use a product that can suddenly increase 100x in cost without warning? Let alone one that can double.

Furthermore, HBAR fees may be fixed but the council can adjust them as they see fit. 

For example, minting an NFT costs $1. Avery Dennison plan to tokenize trillions of products, DLA Piper started out looking at tokenizing real-estate, now their plans go much further than even that. Obviously the adjustability of fees go both ways, I'm not hinging my argument on this particular revenue stream, the point is there's a lot you've missed, including other transaction types with their own associated fees.

Right now, for cryptocurrency transactions the price is fixed at (I think) 0.0001 USD. This is useful in its own right because it allows micropayment based usecases - a market which is completely inconceivable to you right now.

This is adequate at the moment as it incentives adoption and creates new possibilities. 

Right now the plan is to fund node operators through the treasury in the short term, if the current fees prove to be untenable past that stage, they will be changed. Adequately incentivising node operators to secure the network is an integral part of the design.

If, in the future, it is deemed that this particular type of transaction should cost more (or less) then this can be done. 

If the USD falls out of favour, they can find something else to peg it to.

If the miners turn out to be right and DLT is really just about paying a lot of money to miners and hodlers, then they can ramp the fees right up if they so desire.

My point is that this control Hedera have is a unique strength - you might disagree with how they've utilised it (I trust them and their partners a hell of a lot more than a random redditor), but nonetheless, the competing options are simply inferior and nothing else. 

They cannot be controlled or fixed because the gas demands are driven by fundamental limitations in the architecture of the other networks. Hedera's architecture is better. That's why they are being adopted""

Also keep in mind we're talking about unimaginable transaction volume down the line - which Hashgraph has been mathematically and practically proven to be capable of.",1642667970.0,2

Just wanna add that the EVM being integrated into Hedera's native layer means all the benefits like fixed fees and shared functionality are rolled in.



Ethereum has been the focus on development because it's been the most stable platform - yet It will literally be far better to run Eth dApps on Hedera and incredibly easy with no real risk. Just an absolutely brilliant touch as far as I'm concerned and emblematic of the intelligence of their approach across the board.

Not a fan of Layer Twos personally, particularly because I haven't seen any marked advantages over a Hashgraph's native layer that doesn't come with a significant compromise. 

I understand you can make up for the compromise elsewhere but surely you understand why this becomes less and less tenable compared to a layer one solution which apparently achieves optimal performance from a mathematical standpoint in terms of security, throughput, and efficiency, without an apparent compromise.

Maybe quantum computing shakes things up, maybe something else does. Layer 2s are less speculative than that but speculative nonetheless

>The set of shards can be arbitrarily sized, enabling massive parallelization of the consensus process. Notably, this form of parallelization introduces a tunable tradeoff between security and scalability: reducing the number of shards each node covers increases parallelism and scale, but decreases the validator set size of a given shard. This capability allows the system designer to select a minimum threshold of per-shard node coverage that achieves high practical security, while maximizing parallelism and scale by allowing a large number of independent nodes. This is unique to Cerberus and discussed further in the analysis section.

So they can *kinda* place the tradeoff however they want with the way their sharding design works.  But the way they frame it here is the misleading part, and where it reveals that Radix doesn't really solve any new problems because they don't do anything to decrease the overall load of fully verifying the ledger, so sacrificing decentralization as the network utilization increases and compromising its resistance to validator corruption by forcing reliance on third parties.",1642614801.0,1

These are incorrect - processing is also extremely parallel and only happens on the shards related to a transaction.

The Cerberus Infographic series is a great resource that digs into the mechanisms behind Cerberus cross shard consensus and the role the Radix Engine plays to abstract away dealing w/ sharded data from dApps and the developer.

[https://www.radixdlt.com/post/cerberus-infographic-series-chapter-vi](https://www.radixdlt.com/post/cerberus-infographic-series-chapter-vi)

The following are excerpts from Chapters 12 and 13. (It may be easier to open up the pdf versions to find text easily).

&#x200B;

>***Chapter 12 selections - on parallel transactions across shards***  
>  
>Moreover, one of the key concepts that allows this to happen is that of parallel processing. In a future where Radix has scaled to fulfill the DeFi needs of billions of people, the vast majority of transactions will involve completely unrelated substates, shards, and validator sets. Those transactions will be processed entirely in parallel across the vastness of the shardspace without ever being “aware” that the other transactions exist.  
>  
>But not everything can be processed in parallel. There must still be some logic that tells Cerberus when substates are related and must be composed in the same transaction.  
>  
>***Chapter 13 selections - on partial ordering***  
>  
>Therefore ideally, you have a network that’s intelligent enough to only order when it’s absolutely necessary, so that it can process as many transactions as possible in parallel. We therefore want a network that has “partial ordering”  
>  
>....  
>  
>For Radix, that layer of logic is the Radix Engine. It tells Cerberus which substates are related and must be ordered, and which ones are not related and do not need to be ordered and can thus be safely parallelized.  
>  
>So how does the Radix Engine do this?  
>  
>When a transaction is created, it must follow rules stipulated by the Radix Engine. Those rules stipulate that only required substates are used in a transaction, and that when new substates are created, that those are broken down into as many substates as possible, that still make logical sense  
>  
>....  
>  
>Because of the Radix Engine, nodes therefore only need to undertake consensus on the absolutely most minimal set of shards required.  
>  
>If events are not related, they just get processed in parallel, across the entire shardspace, which is so large in size as to be practically infinite.",1642658915.0,4

is people spending large quantities of money* for tokens which represent an image and do little else, a trend which will die out shortly? Hopefully.   

I don't see what problem you think NFTs for music is supposed to solve? You talk about removing middlemen, but NFTs don't seem to provide anything for that that just, letting people buy the song online using a cryptocurrency, doesn't already provide.  

If you think that they could help with DRM for audio in a way that isn't feasible for DRM for images on account of images being screenshot-able, you should know that the same can be done with audio (might be slightly more difficult, but cannot be really protected against.).  

(Also, DRM on music is against freedom)  

I of course agree that being able to more easily create/handle tokens that represent individual intangible things can be useful.

edit: also, if scalability issues are solved (or possibly using a permissioned chain with a large number of known entities, who could be held accountable for any behavior contrary to what the protocol dictates?) then the idea (which some are already pursuing) of using tokens to track what resources went into making products, in order to be assured about where the materials came from, and where the labor and other steps were done, when a manufacturing process involves materials being bought and sold between many companies. Like e.g. where did the oil come from to make this plastic? where was the plastic made? where was the plastic made into parts of shoes? The shoe company presumably doesn't process the oil into plastic themselves, nor the other materials.
Of course, these assurances would only be as trustworthy as those who made them, at least this would make it so they can be tracked. Like, if you are making a cake to sell, you can't generate yourself the assurance that the eggs were from a farm with humanely raised chickens without inventing a made-up farm entity to sign those, which people wouldn't recognize as an existing farm. An actual farm might claim to raise their chickens humanely but not actually do so, and this wouldn't solve that problem, but there are other solutions for that part. This still helps avoid the issue of the cake-maker making up the info about the source of the eggs though. (Because, the problem of checking if a farm exists is even more solved than checking if the farm raises their chickens humanely.)

Another use could be getting certifications that various steps in the process didn't emit large amounts of CO2, or something. Would need certification organizations for that, but still.)",1642553882.0,4

To mint an NFT opensea charges 2.5% of final price , same with rarity and in case of nifty is 5% and 50cents on every secondary sale, This may sound a lot but the thing is that all this gas fee should be there to incentivize the miners, without which all this would never happen.

 Also more users might/might not decrease the gas fee as this would lead to congestion and hence higher the gas fee faster will your nft be minted.

The main way that I have thought about NFTs being useful would be in a subscription/membership based model. Like for example if an exclusive restaurant issued X amount of NFTs that indicated that you held a reoccurring reservation, or just that you were allowed to eat at that particular restaurant. This NFT now not only holds value for the owner of it, but also for the restaurant.

The restaurant would gain an initial investment, and the customer now has an asset that will hopefully appreciate if the restaurant does well. Now if it does appreciate, then the customer could sell the NFT for a profit, the restaurant could then make X percentage on the resale, and would now have record of who the person sold to. This would obviously be a permission based blockchain.

I think that NFTs in particular could be useful for something like this because if it’s a smaller, permission blockchain then it would be easier to track sale and re-sale history. It would also just streamline some processes (re-sale, commission collection, knowing who holds what NFT) that could otherwise be a nuisance, or simply not cost efficient. They could also have an NFT verification system at the restaurant to prevent any forgery. There are definitely other ways to do this outside of just NFTs but this has been the primary way that I see NFTs actually having utility.

Ethereum is like a general purpose decentralised computer where you have a lot of freedom with what you can build on top of it and pay for computation time whether it succeeds or not. Tokens and non-fungible tokens are simply a code standard.

Algorand utilize the account model like Ether. The account model works by removing tokens from one account and adding it to another account in a transaction causing the state of all involved accounts to be a part of the transaction. Instead of being general purpose, it is developed for financial assets and has native support for it. This simplifies some things like asset transfers, has some benefits like fixed cost, and comes with a lot of features and configurability for assets making it suitable for regulated assets.

Cardano use an UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output) model, similar to Bitcoin, instead of an account model. To send a transaction you spend tokens as inputs and create new UTxOs. One address can have several UTxOs so instead of a global state of accounts you have to validate for a transaction, you simply spend a token as an input and create a UTxO belonging to a different address. Cardano doesn't offer feature rich assets like Algorand or decentralised computing like Ethereum but you can accomplish some of the same things by making a Script/UTxO that holds an NFT or Token instead of an account holding it directly.

Some blockchains have a native concept of an NFT built right into the base protocol, and so a smart contract does not need to be deployed. 

As an analogy: there are some operations that your computer can do right in its hardware, and so it is not necessary to write a program to execute them. For instance, arithmetic like integer addition is an operation that modern cpus have a module for (the ALU). It is, however, still possible to do addition without making use of this hardware (although this would be a nutty idea).

I don’t know the gritty details but the jist of it is that L2 passes only the bare minimum amount of info to L1 to change the state along with a SNARK proof the says this condensed new state I’m giving you was created by following all the rules and I didn’t fuck anything up. This approach is nice since it is provably correct the L1 can finalize the state immediately. With optimistic you have to give time to contest. The drawback of providing the ZK proof is that it is very computationally intensive. Compare that to optimistic where there is no extra competition needed until someone breaks the rules.",1642407113.0,18

This is exactly why L2's exist, to take transactions and ""knowledge"" off L1 where it's expensive to have and into L2 where it's much cheaper. 

*"" Are there any safeguards to ensure that L2 doesn't act maliciously?""*

There are two levels of safeguards. The first is in L2 itself, depending on the L2 technology itself and how it's configured, there are generally rules about what you can and can't do and you will be punished if you do not follow them. This ""punishment"" step is often handled by the L1, and this is the second layer of safeguard. For example, if you are transferring coins through some lightning nodes and one lightning node doesn't transfer the coins as promise, a lightning node can take that info to the L1 chain and say ""hey, look, they promised they'd transfer the coins and they didn't!"" and L1 chain will force the transfer or revert the transfer or whatever the rules require. In short, L2 provides transaction capacity while relying on L1 only for enforcing rules when something goes wrong.

For optimistic rollups, the safeguard is that participants who verify the transactions and submit fraud proofs in case of any fraudulent activity.

For ZK rollups, the layer 1 smart contract verifies that the zero knowledge proofs submitted by the layer 2 operators are valid.

\>  What if an L2 operator pushes an update that sends 10% of every transaction to their own wallet

Transactions have to be signed by the sender, otherwise they are invalid. For zk rollups, this means that an operator trying to insert fraudulent transactions will submit an invalid zero knowledge proof that will be rejected by the layer 1 smart contract. For optimistic rollups, this means that a participant who detects the fraud can submit a fraud proof and be rewarded for it while the malicious operator is penalized.

Opening up new revenue streams via resale commission. But the offering for buyers/collectors hasn’t been particularly great. I personally am not interested in the whole “buy to get access to our private discord” - and it looks like being part of an exclusive online club doesn’t seem to be enough now. The issues with theft and rip offs are a real bummer but this happens today in the art world. It’s just that with the blockchain everyone can see how much was stolen and what was used to rip people off. 

The more interesting applications do intrigue me though, as NFTs are proof of ownership having utility in the real world could add real value. Redeemable events, conferences and concerts, access to restaurants and physical goods all exist in the NFT world today. I’m curious how this will pan out. 

In video games the idea of NFTs gets met with a huge amount of hate - not just dismissal. Sure companies need to buy in and invest time to use the blockchain data in their products. But let’s not use the argument of “buy x here use it there”.  Today if you purchase a digital good today it’s account bound. You can sell your account but that’s against TOS in most cases and it’s an all or nothing affair. The company owns your account and can revoke access at any time. Some companies allow you to resell digital goods, but only through their storefront and limited to other users who don’t already have the item. Blockchain would allow you to send, sell or burn on any store that uses that blockchain (or send off chain). If your account gets banned or stolen, your purchases are in your wallet and you can take them with you. Again, it’s the ownership that’s important not the uniqueness in this scenario. 

Then there’s interesting applications in the digital publisher world. If you purchased game licenses as NFTs and could use them at any digital store, and buy or resell through them. The store takes a cut to make some money, the publishers get commission and you actually own the game license. But that’s all pipe dream stuff and not likely. An interesting thought experiment. 

Something to remember when people call NFTs worthless is that they are literally tokens similar to any other crypto based token. The main different with ERC-20 and ERC-721 is that ERC-721 has a unique id and metadata. It’s just that 1 ETH = 1 ETH but 1NFT ≠ 1 NFT. If you agree that ERC-20 tokens have value, given that NFTs are a type of token, then they must have value in both scenarios. It’s just that the demand is a lot lower on one side of the fence, right? And rightly so - most owners want to flip and make money and nothing else. 

It’s worth noting that the metadata can be changed (that’s how NFTs reveal) and that they normally link to IPFS, a web api or URL to pull back the digital item. So the image, sound clip, video, digital selling point of an NFT can go offline in some cases. Then what value does it hold? It’s quite a compelling argument against them if the thing you bought for can disappear, but to each their own.",1642347523.0,2

This is not true if NFT dApp uses IPFS for artworks storage, as IPFS is an example of a content-addressable storage technology (the address of a file is only its hash).

The hash of the file on IPFS works differently than checksum. For example, it is not enough to make a very small change to the image, such as changing a single pixel.

The intention of IPFS designers was to protect data against deliberate (editing of a photo, changing a word in the text) altering the data, and not changing it as a result of accident.

First: speculative assets just about always experience price volatility, often because of expected future adoption. This is the way humans behave, and it is rational in this specific way, even though it seems irrational at arms-length. Because this is the way people behave, it should be expected. 

Second: some real artists have made real NFT art. Kevin Abosch is a widely well-regarded artist (one among many), and he has programmed the creation of NFTs as art. Art collectors would say that has value in the art marketplace. 

Third: if you’ve been in crypto for a while, you must know it works exactly this way. ICOs start making money, then you start seeing billions of new ICOs, most of which are absolutely ridiculous. New joke tokens start seeing their tokens boom, then we start seeing more and more joke tokens. 

Fourth: crypto is irrational as part of its ethos. Have you actually talked to people in the crypto space? They make zero sense most of the time, and that is perfect in its own way. Why? Because crypto has always been about doing something so different and so disruptive—so non-sensical—that regular people would finally have a chance at participating in global markets. We don’t trust intellect or reason or people in this context; instead, we trust the technology. The nature of blockchain is that we do not trust any particular individual; instead, we trust the community which sustains the interest in (and maintenance of) the blockchain. 

It is, in a way, a rebellion. All of these sensible, intelligent economic systems have left people feeling as if they are poor and without viable options. If NFTs also leave people poor and without options, well, at least it was done by choice. (“You think I’m stupid and what I’m doing is stupid?

1) (optional) have the contract which tracks who owns how many of each type of card, allow a feature where you can freeze your ability to transfer the cards for a fixed amount of time  
2) at the start of the match, player’s decks are registered (possibly using some stuff to commit to them without revealing the content of one’s deck to the other player, but still granting them an assurance that one has the tokens for all the cards in one’s deck)  
3) pass back and forth signed messages describing moves and gamestate (and timestamps), in ways that are verifiably valid given the previous state. In order to handle the hidden information of “what cards are in your hand”, use the same techniques which have been used for preventing cheating in [online poker without a central server] .  
4) If any player makes an invalid move, the other player can prove this fact and win (presenting the proof to the smart contract), tell them to make a valid move, or, if they choose, allow the invalid move (if more than 2 players, or if someone other than these two players has an interest in the game, then all players, or a representative for all interested parties, must sign the same message agreeing to accept the invalid move as valid. Alternatively, committing to this not being a possibility can probably be done by using some kind of proof aggregation thing in order to be able to succinctly prove to the contract at the end that all the moves made were valid.)  
5) If a player doesn’t make a move within  a given time limit, then the next player can submit a dispute claim to the smart contract, either where this would count as the other player forfeiting, or skipping their turn, and where the player skipped has a given amount of time during which they can contest this.  
If the player making the claim had previously signed a move which came after the move they claimed wasn’t being made, they are cheating and they lose.  

There is a substantial issue here, where by refusing to make a move, (or, by refusing to send one’s opponent the message describing one’s move), one could force the other player to make their moves on-chain, as you say, which would be problematic.

(Of course, wouldn’t need the entire game state or move description, just a commitment, but still)  

6) finally, final move is verified as valid by the contract (or, if this would be computationally expensive, committed on the smart contract with a claimed result, and only verified by the contract if the claimed result is contested.)

__________

However, a much simpler solution, would be to not even have a smart contract have any transactions during a match at all, where except when cards are being traded/sold/issued/banned/unbanned , the clients simply, check the state of the smart contract, without any transaction happening.  

(Why do you want to be able to cryptographically validate all the moves of a game with a changing card list? That is very complicated with not much benefit.)  

If you want to have betting on the results of the match, just use a 3rd party judge (or panel of judges, depending on the importance of the match).

I don’t think there’s much tendency for judges to cheat or be bribed in big card game tournaments.

And, if there is a standard simulator which encodes the rules of the game, it becomes fairly unambiguous whether a ruling is legitimate. A rules judge who was bribed would lose all reputation as a rules judge.",1642372165.0,1

The current BTC hashrate is ~200 EH/s, so a 51% attack would need ~100 EH/s (100x10^18 H/s).

The Antminer S19 does about 100 TH/s (100x10^12 H/s), so you'd need around a million of them.

In practice that's way more than actually exist, but it's just a thought experiment.

It's a 3kW unit, so each one consumes 24x3 = 72kWh per day.

The cheapest electricity in the US is around 7c per kWh, so at that rate, you'd spend 72x0.07x10^6 = $5.02M / day to maintain a 51% attack.

Of course, that ignores the hardware costs. The retail cost per unit is $11,500, so the hardware alone would be north of $11.5B.

Edit: I just realized that technically it wouldn't be enough to have half the *existing* hashrate, you'd need to *match* the existing hashrate for a 51% attack, so you can double all those figures, and it would be more like $23B upfront + $10M/day.",1642350989.0,16

They are not art, they are an asset. If you invest in an NFT collection you get more than just an image displayed in your wallet. You gain access to the community and depending on the project, passive income, brand awareness, irl events, 3d models, early access to upcoming projects etc.

And possibly emotions of community and identity. Many people still can’t grasp it because they didn’t experience it yet.

I think NFTs are the evolution and combination of meme coins and DeFi. Less abstract, more approachable and more appealing than traditional crypto. I got a free LOOKS drop based on my NFT trading, that is currently staked at 800% APR. The crazy part, this could be (more or less) sustainable because their NFT platform gives 100% of the trading fees to stakers. The high volume is currently mainly based on wash trades but they will take over plenty of volume from Opensea in the long run. Looksrare is a billion dollar venture in the hands of the NFT community. It's just easier and safer for investors compared to providing liquidity on i.e. Uniswap.

Why would a company bother with that? If a game is networked, it still probably needs servers running to control things, since you can't just trust clients. A more decentralized setup that allows self-hosted or private server managed games with smaller groups is feasible, but then you've still got hosts with control. A p2p setup is possible, but then we're getting into a really limited set of games and a lot more complexity for the net code of a game. If you have your own servers to power the networked aspects of a game, then why not have them vend such data as well?

The reality is that reading data from the blockchain directly is pretty difficult today without running a node on the network.

A potentially better way to achieve similar results to what you described would be for a company to have a fully public dataset available at all times. A simple readonly API for it works just fine. If the company servers ever shut off, the community can fork the last state from it and let that be the source of truth. Different clients can all individually fork off on their own as well.

False. Understanding what makes proof of work the single known way to distribute control without central permission takes people a while. Proof of stake has been around and recognized to be an irrelevant fallacy for most of decade, at least in technically literate circles.

Sustainability of completely permissioned centralized systems doesn't really matter if a permissioned centralized system isn't your goal, and if it is we already had much more efficient systems for achieving that for decades.

Also very few seem to grasp the incentives at play in Proof of Work systems which goes far beyond just hash power.

It's incredibly obvious that proof of stake requires permission of previous stake owner to gain any access to control since tokens have owners and stake owners are literally rewarded for withholding control forever. Needing central permission to control is central control. Not only can proof of stake not be ever classified as decentralized, it's literally incentivizing continuous centralization of control.

Proof of work relies on permissionless external resources (matter/energy) for this reason with unforgeably continuous costs for all making it necessary to give up control to break even. It managed to do something completely unprecedented and unique - to prove something was done in outside world on-chain. There is nothing like it.

This is not the case, proof-of-stake coins are inflationary meaning they print coins each block, in many coins, being a large staker means your coins only keep pace with increasing supply (assuming total value of the coin's market stays the same). Staking rewards are generally linear and proportional to the amount of coin you have, so you don't automatically have all wealth converging into a couple of large addresses.

In other words, if you have 10% of the coin supply now and you continue to stake with it, you will still have 10% in five years. Your 10% is now 50 coins instead of 10, but it's the same percent of the market share.",1642300020.0,3

At least proof of stake protocols like Navcoin's give each node the same percentage of rewards each year, +- 7% nowadays in which it doesn't matter if you stake 1 or 100000 coins.

This is done by implementing coin age, meaning that if you have 1 coin staking for a long time it will eventually stake purely because of the time spend staking.

I see it as AR more than VR. 

Imagine adding ambiance/decorations to a restaurant through AR glasses. 

Imagine Pokemon Go but even more immersive. You can have subsets of people walking around interacting with the Pokemon Go universe, where they see Pokemon around them to catch, while another subset of people are tuned into the Avengers, Harry Potter, or LotR metaverse, with whatever that entails. It’d be like LARPing but to the extreme.

Imagine coming home and your entire house is decorated with NFTs: if you want to rearrange things for decor, instead of having to physically move things, you can just move them virtually. You could have a pet dragon, fountains of lava, unicorns, mermaids, and whatever else you want in your home.

In all these interactions, the physical world would still be present, but you are augmenting what’s already there with things that are only possibly virtually. You can even tie NFTs to physical objects. So, for example, you could have a wand that’s just some stick object in the real world, but because you own the NFT for that wand, you can use that stick in the real world to cast spells in the metaverse.

I don’t know if this vision will ever come to pass, but that’s how I can see the metaverse having the most tangible success, rather than some VR game everyone’s playing.",1642103603.0,28

Yes !!

I'm a long time gamer, started with Pokemon Yellow and up to today's games. I've always been a fan not only of playing but of the whole video game culture and the progression of game play along the years.

I was able to try out a VR game about a year ago, and while I thought it would be boring and not so revolutionary, I was hooked up as soon as I entered the tutorial.

So far I didn't dive deep into it because it's not really my cup of tea, but I was really amazed by the possibilities with a technology and games that are still young in my opinion. The immersion was great and to me it's one of the most important part for many games that are supposed to put you in a character shoes or that let you dive in a specific universe.

 So I want to try it out and I want to follow how things will evolve around that, and I think that great things will be possible, despite the fact that it'll probably won't be used the way it's supposed to be (like how social networks are bringing up so many opportunities but are used in a way that's useless and annoying for most).

And don't get me wrong, I will still want and love to go outside camping or whatever, but if the metaverse is gonna be here and if it end up being popular, I want to check how it is at the very least.",1642106288.0,10

Another compelling use case is digital twins - a persistent online presence.

VR/AR is as stated fairly new but the actual concept of a metaverse is not. GTA, Assassin's Creed, C.O.D and many gen games all need a metaverse where players can interact. where crypto and finances go is more towards RP/MMO style games. there was this one game that was very popular called imvu. it actually had its own metaverse and interactions to buy real clothes or furniture brands but to style your in game avi and rooms. 

i believe that as we go forward with communication and social experiences more apps and sites withove towards the RP style interfaces. i can definitely see Instagram doing this. there are many light weight apps and games that can implement a full metaverse/market system that works for the masses. 

you could go on and on with different use cases and reasons/ideas for metaverses but it all boils down to the original meaning and social interaction. there is this ome show called ""westworld"" thats based on a metaverse type. it's probably actually somewhere in the works as we speak. but that would be large scale.

# Social interaction

Online gaming is fun for the social interactions, not the P2E hype nor game genres. Social media & media conferencing is good (if anonymousity mantained) & bad (if IRL identity locked on). Why? Me personally more readily open up myself in anonymous & make friends in like, than being around bunches of elderly that always raise issue of respect & so called ""more wise & experiences"" in life (Hence the death of FB). We trancended the era of respect based on age, race, geographical boundaries, social rank; into respect based on open wisdom & ideologies.

# Administration

Regulations is important in any interaction platforms. However, I trust consistent regulation by artificial intelligence more than by human gut feeling. Guess this blockchain not entirely trustless. AI is emotionless (sin-less), almost to the level of gods. Yes, technology improve interconnectivity like shopping & services, but the administration rules (by single authority) the one that most people complain. Also, platform administration exposure to the users also allows more tolerance & understanding why certain platform actions are taken, instead of shear blame of greed or irresponsibility.

# Others factors

I don't understand the need for VR (some people have 3D sickness) & NFT (abstract artistic value that only the crazy rich can apprehend & accept) too. In game items trading might increase game interactivity, but I understand no further than that. For example, minecraft players can play anonymously (though certain regulation by AI is needed) for social & trading for some in game item might solve scam issue, but everything else is clueless to me.",1642309223.0,1

I am excited to see how Dreem and Unique Network will work. I think that Unique Network interoperability potential is going to be a game-changer when it comes to NFTs.

The costs of NFTs currently are outrageous and unrealistic. Current costs are not what a healthy metaverse would look like. Maybe for collector’s items. But who knows. They’ll cost whatever people are willing to buy and sell em for.

For example, if you have an NFT for a wand in the Harry Potter metaverse that allows you to perform certain very powerful spells, and there are only a few copies of that wand in existence, then it makes sense that it would cost a lot. Now, if that same wand existed in another metaverse and did the exact same things but was abundant, people could switch to that metaverse instead and capitalism would take over from there to determine the optimal price. It all depends on how well developed the metaverse is and how much people are willing to spend for a product in one metaverse environment as opposed to another. 

I’d be willing to bet people would spend a lot more for a powerful wand in the official Harry Potter metaverse than for that same wand in a random no-name metaverse. But if that random no-name metaverse has good developers that create a fun, desirable environment, then that wand could then increase in price.

I’m assuming here that there will be multiple metaverses because I find it hard to believe that there will be one metaverse with a monopoly on the entire space, though that’s entirely possible (could see an Apple vs Android metaverse type of thing happening). If there were to be one main metaverse though, you can bet your ass that any items that are scarce will be expensive as hell. 

I imagine there might be one main metaverse platform that will prevail over others, as it has the best design / SDK, and the majority of developers will choose to develop using their platform, similar to Apple with iPhones. Then other competitor metaverse platforms will try to compete and will be around but won’t be as prevalent as the main one for whatever reason (like Android / Windows phones).",1642115034.0,2

In the short term it is more likely that AR will gain broader adoption (esp. with Apple Glasses, Meta’s partnership with Ray Ban, Snap Spectacles, etc.) while VR continues to evolve in its own niche (gaming, entertainment, perhaps some engineering).

Slightly harder to not realize that one isn’t following when reading than when watching.  

The important thing is doing. 

Get an interpreter or compiler installed and working, and get a very simple program to run (this may be copied and pasted, though it may be better to type it in yourself), and then come up with the simplest change you can think of to what you want it to do, that you think you can make, and make that change.
(I imagine you’ve progressed past “Hello, World.”, but if you were at that stage, a decent first thing to try would be “Hello, Wokeman1.”)

 If it doesn’t work, great! You need to be used to that experience. Figure out why.  
If you get an error message you don’t understand, look it up. 
(Though, before you look it up, read it. I mean, if it is many lines long, you don’t need to read the whole thing, but like, you wouldn’t paste the whole thing into google either.). 

Fix the error.
Get it working.  
Make other changes, of increasing difficulty, which require gradually more understanding.

(Fix the errors you encounter each time.
“There are two alternating steps in programming, adding bugs, and removing them.”)

Ask yourself what you can do with the things you’ve understood so far.  
What would be something neat you could do? What can you do with what you’ve learned so far that is potentially surprising that you can do it with that?
What’s something you aren’t quite sure how to accomplish, but you feel like you’re close to being able to?  
What’s the part that’s missing? Break it down.  
Look it up.  

You don’t need to learn all the language features right away, but you should be on the lookout for language features that you aren’t experienced with yet, and which would make things easier/cleaner (or make things possible).  

If it feels like there should be a way to do something, and it would be useful to you, look it up, see if there is a way.

It reminds me of another crazy idea though: create a ledger for debts and let the community build various coexisting gift economy systems on top.

1. The ledger only stores debts between accounts. Zero is the default, `2^64-1` is the maximum.
2. Two accounts can together agree to change the balance between them however they want.
3. Transactions form something like a DAG. Everything is voluntary, so there's little need for the ledger to actually reach consensus. Let other layers worry about it.

Such a system would have no speculative value and would not work as a value transfer mechanism by itself because anyone can create two accounts and set balance between them to `2^64-1`.

However it may work as a mechanism for scaling real world trust, similar to [Hawala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawala) and other [informal value transfer systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_value_transfer_system).

If Alice and Bob have a relationship and Bob and Charlie have a relationship but Alice and Charlie don't want a relationship, then Bob can be an intermediary when Alice wants to sell something to Charlie. Charlie declares debt to Bob, Bob declares debt to Alice, Alice hands over the goods off-chain.

The same process can be automated for chains of any length. The only requirement is that an escrow hands over Alice's goods to Charlie at the same time Charlie confirms the chain trade.

TL;DR: automate debt accounting in a decentralized way. No enforcement, just accounting. Intuitively it feels like something that has no reason not to work.",1642102177.0,1

Say that one week there's a few strains, and the only difference between them is the transaction fee that goes to the miner/staker. One strain is set at 0, one at some other value, and one at a massively high other value. The producers will choose not to support the 0-payout strain, so it'll die. And on the other hand, the consumers won't choose the massively high fee strain, so it'll die. Eventually, consensus will settle on a fair price for the transaction... but even if a consumer for some reason decided to pay the higher price (maybe in exchange for a expected faster transfer?), then that would still get put on the common ledger, just with a different set of rules applied (higher fee being the different rule). Another strain might support some kind of new technology, but might also incur some additional fee. A strain like this might stay around for a long time, being used by people interested in the new tech who want to pay the fee, but ignored by people who aren't interested in using that tech. Either way, all transfers get written to the same master ledger.

&#x200B;

Well I think there's a few reasons.

A) It helps to quickly achieve a viable compromise because there's new forks being made all the time and old ones getting destroyed.

B) It unites these chains into one chain with variable, simultaneous rules. There's no need to pick between btc or ltc in the long term, because you just have coin and choose which rules you want to follow for each exchange. Your coin is immortal, even if the rules that were in governance when you bought it are no longer around.

C) It prevents the exact thing you bring up. Having old tech like btc and classic eth hanging around crowds the space, and puts money in inferior technology. In an ecosystem like the one I propose, a coin like btc would probably have died off a long time ago - only to be replaced with something much better for the producers and consumers. More people get to use better technology, which leads to faster adoption.

D) This produces rule governance like 3rd gen coins always try to achieve, but without actual voting or governance. Even coins like btc, eth, ada still have hard fast rules and ""commands handed down from above"" that neither the producer nor the consumer have any influence over. By distributing power to those who use it, the people who use it can mold the product to fit their interests. The same is true for producers (miners/stakers) who now have some influence over their own life. Agency produces action. Here, the consumer and producer are both given agency and opportunity to shape their own future. And even better, the two are forced to compromise towards a solution which works for both of them.",1642081685.0,-1

Blockchain is a network and similar to many applications not everything resides completely on the network. Traditionally you have client side code such as GUI and computational logic and network side for communication. To place almost everything on a network is cumbersome and inefficient. This goes against what a blockchain, let alone network is used for.

Programs want just enough data so they can do the computation themselves- not doing computation all the time on the network. Crypto does this because of the protocol which encrypts everything before going on chain.

The premise is that content creators can post content and set a price in FileCoins. The media is encrypted prior to posting to IPFS. Consumers would need to pay for an unlock key. The unlock keys are based on the consumer's public key, therefore can't be shared or reused by others. Now for the ""mining"" part. When someone downloads the content, they are getting it from IPFS, a distributed network of storage providers (seeds). When someone pays for the unlock code, the network scans to see who is seeding the file and gives half the rewards to them and half to the content creator. So, if you want the content for ""free"", you need to seed it to many others. The seeding part is optional, it is a cost in storage and bandwidth to the user. 

Users can also seed other content that they never intend to unlock just to earn FileCoin in order to unlock a file of their choice at a later date. It's also similar to the model of BAT. In BAT, you watch ads to earn BAT then you later spend BAT to view premium content.

As for protections, I think the only thing FileCoin could do is prevent duplicate hashes from being posted. I wouldn't be able to download your media, unlock it, then post it as my own...

I saw that you addressed this by saying how it could be minute amounts of crypto to not tax the computer, however, you then sort of create the problem that creators have with Youtube and Spotify. You'll then need mass amounts of views to really have any sort of financial gain, except now there won't be an algorithm that helps you create this virality and gain these views.

“Would you use Youtube if every video you watched, arbitrary code by the video creator is run?”

No, but… this wouldn’t be “arbitrary” code. It would be an established system that people agree to use, and the only thing that would change from video to video or creator to creator is the content and/or the wallet the crypto is being sent to. That’s it. Everything else would be as consistent, verifiable and consented to as using a certain video codec to watch a certain video format. What’s “arbitrary” about that?

I’ve already addressed the concern about trojans, malware and piracy, and how they’re already a problem with every form of content distribution we already use.

Nothing’s stopping Disney from putting malware into the code for streaming Disney+ content or downloading a piece of paid content… except for the fact that if they did that, people would find out and nobody would use Disney+ anymore.

Nothing’s stopping people from putting malware into torrent files on The Pirate Bay. And they do! But guess what?! People still take their chances and download pirated torrents every damn day, learning to avoid certain uploaders if they gain a bad reputation, etc… but there’s still tons of trusted content that is clean and accessible, and most importantly FREE at the point of transaction, which is why so many people continue to pirate content. 

That is pretty much all I want. That exact same model as the torrent/piracy system, except in a legitimate, legal system that would ensure the content owners get paid for their work, instead of getting nothing like they currently do from pirated torrents. They’d be the ones uploading their own content, instead of pirates who stole it.

And again, even if pirates do still steal it and try to upload on the same system (which wouldn’t work anyway, because the system wouldn’t verify a duplicate upload from someone else), or on some other platform, what could a pirate offer to people that would make them want to download their copy of the file, instead of the creator’s copy? Nothing. Because the creator’s copy is every bit as free and accessible, with the added advantage of having legitimacy and reputation behind it. If a creator so chose, they could find whoever uploaded the pirated version, because the blockchain would provide a public record of it, and charge them for stealing content, just as you would with any copyright infringement done via today’s technology. The public record of the blockchain would itself be a disincentive to pirate, on top of there already being less of an incentive to pirate already-free-and-accessible content. For the same reason most Youtubers don’t have to worry about their content being pirated, the content already being free tends to nip the desire for a pirated version in the bud. People pirate Netflix stuff, though, because Netflix has a subscription paywall. This is why the no-cost-to-the-consumer part is so important.

“Do you know about the log4j exploit? It’s similar in that this would open a window to remote code execution.”

Okay, I get that this is a potential risk, but again… why is that different for this idea than it already is anything and everything that people download and use on their computers? How is it so much more of a concern for this than it is for, say, downloading and running a node for the PI Network, for example, or any other blockchain? How is it more of a risk than what a lot of creators already do by selling a downloadable MP4 through their website?

I mean, is this not what blockchain technology is all about? A system of verification via nodes on a network of computers? The technology/coding expertise needed to figure how to make it as secure as possible would be a given in developing this idea, but I feel like a lot of that work has already been done in blockchains of various uses. What you’re asking me is essentially the same as asking why Bitcoin should be trusted. Does installing a Bitcoin wallet and transferring Bitcoin to it not open these same type of concerns? If not, why not? If so, why doesn’t it invalidate mining or storing Bitcoin, but it invalidates watching videos via the same type of system? All that’s different is the code would contain the data that makes up a video instead of a Bitcoin token. If we can verify Bitcoin data, then we can verify video data, no?",1642053640.0,1

648,CryptoTechnology,Would this be possible?,AWS-77,1641991253.0,167,16,0.64,"Well yeah, the idea is entirely based on the collective mining power of as many viewers as you can get. The consumers would be completely aware of this and agree to it and everything, so I don't know why you're characterizing it as ""malware"". Malware is malware because it's ""malicious"", as in people don't want it in their computers because it does damage or slows things down and often they don't even know about it or can't get rid of it. This wouldn't be anything like that, so how is it malware?

The consumer would download the file and when they open it, they're met with a dialog box that says something like ""Playing this file will run a crypto-miner for the duration of the content. Do you consent?"" ... if they don't, they don't do it. If they do, they click Yes, and the file checks with the system to verify the file is legit and untampered with, passes copyright checks, etc, and then plays it. The miner runs in tandem with the playing of the file, so imagine you make a 10-minute video, so 10-minutes of mining time per view, and get as much as 1000 viewers to view it... that's 10,000 minutes of mining time on your video. Now imagine you get a million views. A hundred million views. A billion views. Like I said, it wouldn't have to be much mined per view for it to add up to a big sum for the creator. If you don't get many views, you don't get many rewards, but what else is new in the world of content monetization?

The concern about people with more powerful machines hogging all the rewards doesn't seem relevant, when the rewards are going to the creator anyway, from wherever they happen to be when they're mined. I'd think that would actually discourage people from lending more processing power than they would need to just to get the video to play, because there'd be no incentive for them to if they're not getting the rewards. They just want the video to play. You could set like a base minimum amount of processing power that's required to verify the file and ensure a base amount of mining, and then add the option to allow more processing power than that, if you wanted, which would raise the collective mining power and generate more rewards for the creator per view, so it'd be an act of generosity on the viewer's behalf to donate their processing power, which I'd imagine people would do if they really like a creator (could even include a tipping option as well if they want to be even more generous). As long as the minimum is an amount that the average iPhone could do (which, come on, those things are getting pretty impressively powerful now and only increasing going forward), then it would be enough to make the system work and get some amount of mining rewards out of each view. If the person's device isn't powerful enough to even reach the minimum, then it would have to be a pretty old device and they should accept the consequences of their lagging on keeping up with technology, the same as if your old phone doesn't support a new app or OS.

So looking at it this way, if the average processing power across all viewers' devices was enough to generate, say, a cent's worth of crypto for about 10 minutes of viewing, then if you got a million views, you'd have a thousand bucks for 1 million views on a 10 minute video. The same for half a million views on a 20 minute video and so forth. Feature films could generate around $120,000 from a million views at that rate. Now imagine the value of the cryptocurrecy goes up to make it so you're mining $1 worth for 10 minutes of viewing. A 2-hour movie now makes $12 million from only 1 million views. A 3-hour movie makes $18 million. Now imagine you're Hollywood, where you can attract tens of millions or hundreds of millions of viewers with movies that people will watch again and again for years to come... think major studios and rich filmmakers might be interested in investing at this point? Crypto price goes up, rewards go up... so on and so on.

Maybe those amounts are overly-optimistic, but it would all depend on how well the cryptocurrecy's price does, and like I said, if the system attracted the attention of the likes of Hollywood, Bollywood, the music industry, television studios, news media, etc... that price could get pretty damn high with not a lot of mining needed per view to generate substantial rewards from mass amounts of views.",1642088757.0,1

&#x200B;

>The inspiration for the idea came from a mix of the Brave Browser and NFTs, so I just assume crypto is the arena in which this idea would work best.

The basic attention token (BAT) is pretty much as close as a solution creators can get to getting paid in a safe and reliable way for their content. It trades off reliance to third party advertisers to user safety and ease of use. In a sense, your proposed idea is similar to brave but with this balance tweaked.

&#x200B;

>With your suggestion of shasum, does it have the same decentralization and public ledger security that blockchain offers?

shasum is a checksum  program that can produce a deterministic hash string given the same input. This could be used in combination with digital signatures to verify that the file contents + signature is valid making files linked to their original creator as long as the file and signature have not been modified. This is not hard to implement using existing code libraries. It is decentralized (trustless) in that the user is able to verify for themselves that a file is untampered. This would just be a technique that could be integrated into the entire ecosystem but does not offer middle man less content payments.

&#x200B;

>What’s “arbitrary” about that?

It's arbitrary in that it would be different for each file. Each file/content creator would have to set their own crypto mining script to run. And people with bad intent can do much worse than having a crypto miner run while the file is open.

&#x200B;

>And again, even if pirates do still steal it and try to upload on the same system (which wouldn’t work anyway, because the system wouldn’t verify a duplicate upload from someone else)

Your file system will still use existing file formats such as mp4 for videos and mp3 for audio under the layer of abstraction the new format provides. People can and definitely will extract the underlying content though reverse engineering or what not to extract the raw content. Then these files can be wrapped in your new file again but with the pirate's payout address.

&#x200B;

>what could a pirate offer to people that would make them want to download their copy of the file, instead of the creator’s copy?

The pirate's copy is there to deceive unsuspecting people and ""steal"" views from the original creator.

&#x200B;

>If a creator so chose, they could find whoever uploaded the pirated version, because the blockchain would provide a public record of it, and charge them for stealing content, just as you would with any copyright infringement done via today’s technology.

You seem to want the files tracked via blockchain. But what is the merit in tracking static files on a decentralised server? Again, blockchain is overkill for your idea. Also, just from the nature of blockchain and international law, the creator won't be able to find out who the pirates are and take them to court. A content publisher, whether original or pirate, will always just be a public key represented on the blockchain making it impossible to find out who owns the public key.

&#x200B;

>why is that different for this idea than it already is anything and everything that people download and use on their computers?

Because the file type you have proposed is an EXECUTABLE script/program with attached content. People go around torrenting movies off the internet because the file format is just a multimedia storage dump where no code is executed. A crypto miner is fundamentally a script that runs on a computer where as a MP4 file is a bunch of data that is interpreted and displayed by a MP4 player. It has no other capabilities that storing data.

&#x200B;

>Does installing a Bitcoin wallet and transferring Bitcoin to it not open these same type of concerns?

Because Bitcoin wallets don't execute crypto miners or any other arbitrarily set code. Your system would be similar to having bitcoin wallets that allow people to send code fragments to each other and then having those fragments executed on the recipients machine when they open their wallet.

&#x200B;

>All that’s different is the code would contain the data that makes up a video instead of a Bitcoin token

That's what you are misunderstand. When you make or receive a bitcoin transaction, no code is executed on your local hardware where as with your system, a crypto miner, which is CODE, is executed on your machine. The difference being, the file affects your machine where as a bitcoin transaction cannot. There cannot be a zero trust model going on when you have to trust the content creator that they haven't included malicious code in their content.

&#x200B;

I don't even think the piracy potential of your system is even an issue. It's just a side effect. The biggest issue is that the model allows for scripts/code to be executed on user's machines and the single point of trust is the file uploader. This is  a fundamental flaw that I would face if I was tasked with creating such a system. I'm sure there are smarter people who can come up with ideas to make middle-man less content payment systems or better yet implement your system in a way that is safe for users, but I, and many people in this thread, don't seem to think that is possible.",1642163412.0,1

In short: it’s a good idea, it’s just that nobody has been able to figure out how to actually do it in practice. 

As I see it, the crux of the problem is wrapped up with block rewards. Let’s start with blockchains that have constant block rewards - meaning, the amount of crypto mined per block is constant no matter how many people are mining.  The amount of crypto you mine is therefore approximately proportionate to the _fraction_ of total compute power your device has compared to the compute power of the rest of the computers in the network combined. With Bitcoin, this means that if you mine on a cellphone for a hundred years, you won’t make a single penny (or something on that scale). 

On the other hand, let’s say your blockchain has variable rewards, so that more mining means more crypto created per block. Here, you face a different problem: inflation of the coin. If the rate of inflation goes up as mining increases, the value of the coin may plummet. I won’t matter if it means that low powered devices are able to mine at least a small number of coins, because those coins will have so little value it wont matter.

Here’s what would happen in the system your imagining: people would mine crypto for themselves by consuming the content that they create, and they would do this with powerful machines.  (Nobody has been able to figure out a way of preventing this - for instance, it’s not very difficult make a single powerful machine appear like many smaller machines, so you couldn’t just make a rule preventing large machines) This would drive down the amount of crypto that could be mined on consumer devices - because it’s not about how powerful they are, it’s about how powerful they are _compared to the other miners_. 

I see how you’re trying to construct this system, so that collectively lots of people watching the same video will end up mining enough coin to be worth it together. So far, nobody has been able to figure out the economics of this well enough to make this actually work in practice. In the best case, a small amount of crypto would be mined for videos that go viral, most crypto goes to miners watching their own videos, and every other video would get zero crypto. 

This is why I said it’s well suited for malware. I’m not saying that your imagining malware, I’m just saying that it does actually generate money efficiently in a malware context. With malware, you’d gets lots of peoples devices all mining for you for long periods of time- and this would function similar to the “watching your own videos” scenario I described, which is how most coins would be mined. 

All that being said - it’s still a nice idea! It’s just that there are difficult problems that nobody has been able to solve yet that need to be solved for it to work.",1642111025.0,1

Nobody would be able to repost content on the system or post copyrighted material they don’t own without it being treated the exact same way Youtube would treat it.

The verification would make it so that every file downloaded from a creator’s upload would need to be verified that it matches the original upload, or it won’t play. If someone tries to repost it on the system to monetize it themselves and cut out the creator… the system would detect that upload’s content as matching the content of the original upload, the same way Youtube’s algorithm detects and blocks copyrighted material. The same would go for posting copyrighted material that’s not on the system, where the owners of the copyright in question would have the same recourse they currently have with Youtube. Whatever the copyright laws in the country in question are, they would apply and be enforceable by the system’s algorithms.

I figured this all would have been clear when I said that the files need to be verified to work. It’s part of the reason I assume blockchain technology would work, because it’s all about transactions being approved by verification of authenticity in a decentralized peer-to-peer network.

I feel like you’re still kinda missing the point of the collective mining and the fact that the rewards go to the creator, not the people doing the mining. It doesn’t matter if a person with a cellphone doesn’t have enough power to ever get rewards… as long as they’re contributing even a tiny bit to the collective mining power, then that’s all that matters. To the creator, it doesn’t matter if the rewards are coming from a million people or 1 guy with a supercomputer… it’s all the same to the creator. The point of having a large pool of consumers viewing the content is to spread that around as much as possible, and wherever the balance falls in terms of who’s doing the most mining, then so be it. It’s not a competition between the miners like it is when they’re competing for the rewards, because they’re all just working together to reward the creator. I think that requires a fundamentally different way of thinking about it compared to normal crypto mining, and I’m not sure you or anyone else here is really grasping that aspect of it. If you’re saying that no current blockchain technology could work this way, then I guess I am actually suggesting an evolution of the technology that would require a whole new type of collective mining method to be developed. And yes, I realize that’s a big ask.


The issue of people just viewing their own content to reward themselves… again, so be it, if that happens. I don’t think that would prevent them from still contributing a substantial amount to other creators, because as much as I personally love watching my own content (I made it the way I like it, after all!)… I can’t spend ALL my time watching my own content. Sooner or later, I’m gonna wanna watch some other people’s shit. I’m gonna wanna throw on a movie or tv show or any of the type of content I’m interested in. Nobody would ever JUST watch their own content and NEVER anybody else’s. I mean, do current filmmakers who have movies on Netflix just stream their own shit all day long to rack up views on it so Netflix pays them more? Probably not. And even if they did, I don’t think that’s necessarily a problem at all. In the case of a blockchain, as long as they’re running the node, they would still be contributing to powering the blockchain with their mining, so even if they’re just watching their own content, they wouldn’t just be free-loading.

On the issue of inflation, I do see that being a potential problem, but not necessarily any more so than any cryptocurrency that isn’t hard-capped on supply like Bitcoin is (Ethereum or Doge, for instance). Maybe it could be hard-capped and still work somehow? But I figure not really, once all the coins are mined. Ideally, it wouldn’t be capped, so it can go on in perpetuity, and the creators with a vested interest in keeping the price up would keep re-investing some of their profits back into the system. And again, just imagine how much investment capital would be pumped into it if the likes of Hollywood et al got on board. I think that would overcome inflation for a pretty good while at least. I mean, for example, how long do we think Ethereum can stay valuable enough without a hard-cap to prevent inflation? For that matter, how long do we think fiat currency can remain valuable enough to keep the economy functioning with all this inflation going on? It’s a widespread problem, so again, if other systems that face these same problems have managed to work well enough for as long as they have and/or will… this system could too.

And finally, yes, I certainly understand this is all tough stuff to figure out and make work, but that’s why I came here to see what the actual obstacles are.

https://hbr.org/amp/2020/05/building-a-transparent-supply-chain

Blockchain technology has a few beneficial characteristics that you mentioned: immutability, transparency, and decentralization. However, private rather than public blockchains can be designed in a centralized way that still utilizes the other benefits. This is what IBM, Walmart, and some other companies are doing for supply chain blockchain tech. Some highlights from the article:

“A blockchain is valuable partly because it comprises a chronological string of blocks integrating all three types of flows in the transaction and captures details that aren’t recorded in a financial-ledger system. Moreover, each block is encrypted and distributed to all participants, who maintain their own copies of the blockchain. Thanks to these features, the blockchain provides a complete, trustworthy, and tamperproof audit trail of the three categories of activities in the supply chain.”

“Blockchain thus greatly reduces, if not eliminates, the kind of execution, traceability, and coordination problems that we’ve discussed. Since participants have their own individual copies of the blockchain, each party can review the status of a transaction, identify errors, and hold counterparties responsible for their actions. No participant can overwrite past data because doing so would entail having to rewrite all subsequent blocks on all shared copies of the blockchain.”",1641953053.0,8

NFTs are, as you said, an entry in a database. By themselves, they are useless, just as useless as a monkey picture, a ""plot of land"" in a game that never launches, etc.

But your house deed, or your car registration are also a registries in a database somewhere...  the difference is the correct people pay attention to that database entry, and act accordingly.

NFTs are the same... by themselves they are just a piece of information saying ""bob owns XYZ"", but if a government minted then, and recognized the NFT as the deed to your house, then it's a deed. If a sports company mints them, and recognizes them as a valid ticket, then it's a ticket. If EA recognizes that NFT as your legendary pink camo skin, then the NFT IS a pink camo skin.

Making normal ""database entries"" into NFT has some disadvantages. For example, manipulating them (buying, selling, minting) has an inherent network cost to it. They are slower than printing a paper ticket, or saving a database record to a centralized database, etc.

They also have advantages: They are in a public space so they can be verified (travel companies can't overbook a plane without it being noticed, EA can't mint more than 100 of the ""Only 100 limited edition Messi shirt""), also, you can trade or sell the NFT to whoever you want (when you get bored of that pink camo skin for example), also, no-one needs to know WHO you are, whoever can cryptographically prove they own the NFT ""own"" the asset the NFT represents.",1641815172.0,17

683,CryptoTechnology,Giving life to NFT's,AnonymousOceanStorm,1641810292.0,206,49,0.8,"Some comments:

1. NFTs are tokens, not the art. You are not paying to obtaint the artefact, you are paying to be registered as the token-owner.

2. Blockchains have limited and costly storage, whereas artworks have presumably high definition preferences. So art is not stored on the chain. Instead, a pointer to a URL is stored. Presumably that contains the requisite art, but if the server goes down/stops serving it/serves something else then you won't find your chosen artwork there, you'll find a 404 or whatever.

3. Blockchains are deterministic - a block has to be verified, which means everyone verifying it has to reach the same conclusion about the resulting block.  In some chains (Blockchain, Ethereum) the entity mining a block is unknown, so you can have future information which isn't known until the block begins to be mined, but you can't insert randomness inside the block in any chain I've seen.

4. As blocks have to be verified, everyone can run the algorithm to work out what the block contains. So even if you did store the artefact on chain, everyone can check that the new version of the artefact is correct, so they can also generate it.

5. Blockchains solve one specific problem: that in a digital era where all information is easily perfectly copied, it is hard to construct a system that enforces scarcity. So NFTs are tokens which are constructed to be scarce, in as much as you need the owner's permission to modify the ledger entry. Trying to use this system to create a non-copyable or non-replicable artefact misses the point; artefacts are assumed to be replicated perfectly.

6. Suppose you wanted to create such a system to create a time-dependent artefact, e.g. it has the date in the corner which is updated every day, and you still want this on the chain because you want that time-dependence to be independent of any centralized image server. This would mean that at least one block of the chain every day has to include the regeneration of your image, and you would have to pay the gas fees for this regeneration, every time.

To be honest, this goes against the point of a distributed ledger - if you want to prove you're the current owner of the token, you point to the public ledger and let people check for themselves.

If you want to create an artefactory which combines your artefact with the date and your ownership proof, then that might be a fun service, but it's one that would exist parallel to the ledger, not on it or generated by it.",1641838598.0,1

My gut feeling is no, because blockchains in general and autonomous contract chains like Ethereum in particular act like one collectively-run, slow computer. So requiring that it does a computation so unreasonably hard that no one could get to the answer quicker seems not to fit.

It might be possible with a function as you describe, in that the verification doesn't have to be as slow, but you still require the computation to be performed by every mining node, and if the computation wasn't contained and continued in every block, then it could be outpaced. 

None of this improves the energy wastage argument against PoW chains.

Ultimately assuming that some function's eventual output can't be predicted by someone out there with a faster computer ignores the reality that there are some people out there with faster computers.

Fees have several purposes:

* pay miners (and proposers on the beacon chain)
* prevent loops and infinitely execution of pseudo-turing complete code
* Gas arbitrage

EIP-1559's purpose is to make fees more predictable, not necessarily to make it cheaper. And it also keeps the overall monetary inflation almost negligible. (Despite most people misunderstanding, its current circulating supply is less inflationary than Bitcoin's, but monetary inflation isn't necessarily bad in the first place.)

Without high fees, the network security degrades, and you can't expect it to hold on altruism alone.

Ethereum's ecosystem is sustainable indefinitely even with its proof of work consensus. Bitcoin and most blockchains are unsustainable with current transaction fees. When Bitcoin's block subsidy declines by 99% in 30 years, its transaction fees are probably going to go up 5-50x. Similarly, many blockchains subsidize their block rewards and staking for 5-10 years. Those blockchains will also need to transition to a different economic model once they approach their time bomb.

Ethereum is different in that it's already economically-sustainable and will get cheaper with rollups and data sharding.",1641914789.0,8

Yes it's still expensive but at the time it was expensive AND unpredictable meaning you could pay $250 for a transaction and still have it not go through and lose the fee anyway because you didn't accurately predict the cost. I think they acted out of pressure and really pushed this protocol through out of needing to act. 

Prioritizing deflation through burning also gives a little head start to the idea of rewarding those with a bigger hold of ETH which was never really a thing before. The idea is that over a long enough time, the more ETH you hold the better off you'll be if it's deflationary and it's meant to reward those people, not average joe users. Again I'm not sure exactly why this was prioritized over sidechain development but here we are, it's just how the devs decided to go about it. I'm speculating but maybe they saw the rise of other L2s and sidechains and see that as a bandaid for the time being, allowing them to focus their energy on the PoS merge/difficulty bomb which seems to be their #1 priority at this point, and putting sharding on the backburner for now",1641911422.0,2

No. If the market decides that a unit of gas is worth 100 gwei, then it's worth 100 gwei at that specific point in time. The fact that ~90% gets burned doesn't mean that the fair market value is actually 10 gwei and everyone else is overpaying by 90 gwei. If you artificially reduce the basefee so that the cost is 10 gwei, then you'll just suffer the known consequences of price fixing. If anything the priority fee would then jump to 90 gwei and the miner would get it.

EIP1559 didn't change the market value of gas, it just overhauled the dynamic. Instead of miners getting that 100 gwei, the network gets it. It makes more sense this way, the network is offering blockspace, not the miners. The miners are basically ""employees"" providing security to the network and getting compensated for it with the reward of 2 ETH every block they mine.

In order for proof of stake to work, there must be some value accrued to the token on the base chain.

It makes your fund highly illiquid, requires nearly 100% uptime, all the bandwidth/storage costs of running a node, and gets you a much bigger exposure to the inherent risks of the network (can't pull out your money as easily if something goes wrong). This is a non-negligible cost, especially given the very high minimum amount of funds required to stake. 

>no reason to give any control 

what control?? There is no on-chain governance. You don't get to control much as a validator. It's not an active ""i have money therefore all the power to change the rules"" scheme, it's more of a passive ""i have money, i put it up as a stake to show i won't mess with anything so that I dont get it slashed"". The most you can do as a validator is censor transactions, and even then it's pretty rare for any given validator to get selected for a block proposal.

IRRELEVANT TINY COST. you can have just part of your funds stake, in fact pos lets you sell part of coins from reward while still being able to grow % control you have at same time. and the key here is unforgeable costs that automatically adjust to make sure costs are as large as rewards, not some miniscule costs of having uptime. that's nothing compared to billions of dollars in rewards and completely free 72 million eth premine just for 1 party.

and just like with any blockchain, incentives control blockchains so they get to change rules ona whim including who owns what allowing confiscations, dilutions, and so on like the imbeciles of ethereum foundation have already done

\>  it's pretty rare for any given validator to get selected for a block proposal

rare lol. with 72 mil free central eth split between easily sybil'able millions of nodes you can run you can ensure you'll be selected way more than any outsider. censoring users is literally what makes it a 100% permissioned system as we ALWAYS knew about pos and fact stake has owners.

That's why its so important PoW depends on an external resource like matter/energy that's permissionless and makes it unforgeably costly on top of that to take away all incentive to control and why PoS has always been just something that requires infinite illiteracy on this topic. PoS is ""secure"" in same way a database is secure, and that has nothing to do with permissionless protocols.

You can audit it yourself just fine. They can't magically print themselves more coins without breaking consensus rules, and they can't hide coins that haven't had an appropriate state transition. This is literally why all the initial transactions are all there in the genesis block: https://etherscan.io/block/0

>IRRELEVANT TINY COST

Exactly! Much tinier costs for the same economic security (if not more) as PoW. Win win for energy usage globally, and win win for the minimum viable issuance which is why it will drop drastically post-merge. But once the supply shock happens you will switch from calling the merge ""a false promise who will never happen, from devs who constantly never delivery"" (or whatever) to ""a coordinated gimmick with no other goal than to pump the price"". 

>making blocks, mev, censorship

Polkadot's main offering is security - every chain using the same security so there's no hiccups in how chains communicate / transact with each other but that takes away sovereignty as you can't really customize your chain to a degree that may be required and adds a risk of complete network exploitation should a vulnerability be found - that's the risk of having a single point of failure. Developers are forced into Polkadots framework and the $DOT token or they simply can't build on it - but if you do, you don't have to worry about security. Polkadots network is currently also a lot more expensive than Cosmos if you look at fees, staking requirements etc.   

Cosmos's main offering is sovereignty and customization - you are given a Cosmos SDK and you can build w/e chain you want with it, with an ability to customize various modules to your liking or your chain needs. Cosmos will also offer Interchain security but unlike Polkadot, no one will be forced into using it - projects can build their own validator networks if they like. The same with $ATOM token, you are not forced to use it to utilize the Cosmos network - in contrast to $DOT. There's some baseline requirements that a chain must meet to connect to the Interchain and it remains to be seen if they are sufficient security wise for the network to continue healthy functioning - so far there hasn't been any problems or exploits. It is also much cheaper to utilize Cosmos to chase yields on the network, staking, etc. 

Gavin Wood sees Cosmos as competition these days (few years ago he saw it as complimentary) as Cosmos's 'Internet of chains' or as it's called 'IBC' went live earlier last year and has been growing with prominent chains connecting to it:

https://mapofzones.com/?testnet=false&period=24&tableOrderBy=totalIbcTxs&tableOrderSort=desc

It remains to be seen who wins the decentralized interoperability race - like I mentioned below, both solutions are too similar (despite having differences) and in my opinion there will be a clear leader eventually.",1641734867.0,42
776,CryptoTechnology,ELI5 Interoperability: cosmos vs polkadot,yasserius,1641720114.0,138,89,0.99,"Polkadot is kind of a Unity for blockchains, it gives you a standardized SDK (Substrate) with which you build blockchains without the hassle of setting up bridges between them or having to worry about spinning up your own validators. But the bigger value is from the pre-built modules.

For projects it essentially turns developing a blockchain into the functional equivalent of developing a smart contract dApp on Ethereum. Only you get a lot more customizability because you have control over many of the underlying systems, e.g. which token to use for gas fees, who pays for gas and how, what kind of features the blockchain has natively etc.

An underrated benefit is that Polkadot gives you clout and distribution. If you're parachain you get a ton of marketing and BD exposure, kind of similar to an app store. Imho the validator thingy is not as relevant, even if Polkadot marketing loves to rave about it. You still need to work on getting collators and paying them, so the burden is similar.

Cosmos is bit more lower level than Polkadot, but very similar. It's a bit harder to give a game dev analogy, I guess it's kind of like using an Xbox/PS SDK? In that you're given the basic tools but you still need to work on your own modules for most things. 

Cosmos is definitely much more confederated than Polkadot. You'll notice that the success of LUNA or OSMO had virtually no impact on ATOM. Part of it is non-existent tokenomics, but it also reflects the fundamental separation between the Cosmos blockchains. I think here Polkadot also wins as projects actually have a reason to connect to other parachains. It's all one integrated ecosystem.",1641761783.0,14

* Ethereum started as a single chain, and is aiming to build many additional sub-chains (rollups) that all share the same security and are interoperable
* Cosmos is currently an ecosystem of many independent blockchains, and is aiming to add shared security and interoperability (through IBC)
* Polkadot aims to launch with independent, interoperable chains with shared security

You can see that they all have the same goals, but some have opted to launch earlier and add features later, while others have opted to build a complete project before launching.

IMO, they all have the right goals, it's just a question of who can execute best. Ethereum has massive network effects, but it's more challenging to build rollups on top of an existing chain. Polkadot has a very comprehensive design, but the fact that it's taken them so long to start rolling out Parachains means other projects have attracted more marketshare. And Cosmos falls somewhere in the middle.

While Cosmos makes it easier with the SDK to reinvent the security wheel. Both have pros and cons.

But we are actually comparing an Azure/AWS approach of Polkadot, in which developers don't need to worry about reinventing the infrastructure, with going from pure Javascript to jQuery ""SDK"" (Cosmos approach).

 I don't think a development team will choose between them, for the team it will be pretty obvious what they want. Most new teams and some existing teams will pick Polkadot because they can focus on adding value to the users without worrying how much CPU they will need in 5 years and buying a server (analogy to AWS/Azure) and the existing teams who already have a chain and need to pivot to an ecosystem will probably choose Cosmos because they can replicate with a finer granularity their already built security mechanism (analogy to SDK) 

If you want to bet, bet on which season are we in development... Are we in spring or summer, and the developers are still coming to the blockchain space, or are we in autumn or winter and all the developers are consolidating into a couple of ecosystems...

The actual biggest trove of data is PUBLIC POSTS FOR THE ENTIRE PLANET TO SEE!!!!

> How anyone can believe a company with Facebook's track record of data mining wouldn't track EVERYTHING YOU DO IN THE METAVERSE?

I mean,.. the public blockchain will track everything you do.  Go to etherscan. You can't hide this stuff.  I think people have a fundamental misunderstanding on the concept of what a ""*public* ledger"" is or on a more basic level, ,just what the concepts of ""public"" and ""private"" mean.

To be fair, the worst thing he's done is show people the type of content they love and can't get enough of.

And this is from someone who deleted their Facebook account.  I'm not a fan of Facebook but a lot of people's hatred for them is kinda loopy and not really based off of facts.  Just made up stuff.  The worst thing they do is show people the type of content they love to see.  I would ""shame on your for liking that"" way before I say ""shame on them for not blocking you from seeing it"".  Especially the shit facebook gets in trouble for.  It's not like they're actively promoting child porn or stuff with actual victims. Facebook didn't pull some *Clockwork Orange* shit and strap you to your chair, force your eyeballs to never blink and then force feed you this content.

Facebook was caught up in a huge fraud scandal five to ten years ago when it came out they were massively overstating the kind of views videos got on their platform. Content producing companies pivoted to Facebook and video and when the truth came out it collapsed an entire industry (funny or die, collegehumor, cracked, about a dozen smaller companies all shuttered after this). The specifics are they would autoplay videos on their scroll and count that autoplay as a view essentially counting the existance of the video on someones feed as a view. They have an incredibly low bar for honestly in financial reporting and should not be relied on",1642696573.0,6

Facebook does something else. It makes itself primarily a place for people to get their news articles, attention harvesting, followed by ads, and information harvesting about you or I. It then finds the one or two issues you and I disagree on, finds a Fox News article from a journalist who has internalised the billionaire owners perspective, pops it up in front of us, and now that's how two people meet, maybe for the first time - with an intense 3rd party mediator harvesting our consciousness and anger for money.

Facebook and it's sub-products are all free. And no business can grow giving that much and not getting anything out of it. Of course large or even small-sized companies will try to monetize something after their free-service. Otherwise they wouldn't be able to provide that service unless they sell or force you do buy stuff. 

Question is simple. Would you rather not have Whatsapp and pay for each call you will make to your friend or each message you will send like in old times instead of giving away a fraction of your data anonymously for seeing some related ads? If that's your way, you can still do that. Of course same goes for social media as well. No one forced people to use Facebook and Instagram, they can simply shut their account down and act like the they never exist. 

By the way, I'm not saying that companies should be allowed to do unlawful things just because they provide free service.

The move was absolutely necessary as MCO was seen by agencies as a security, and at the time that is not good for any crypto. 

They pivoted, they offered ~at the time~ a relatively fair exchange rate. No it wasn't at historic all time highs of MCO, and yes you can argue they could have done it sooner so people got a better exchange rate, but in the longrun swapping and holding CRO would mean you are *way* up on your assets.

I can understand this criticism if CRO just died or it performed awfully, but it didn't. They made good on their promises so far and have handled their company incredibly competently relative to others.

I was completely worried about BTC energy use and I thought that there was a very big problem BUT tthrough this hearing I've discovered: 

Bitcoin Mining is not destroying the environment but accelerating green energy production by providing a stable baseline when demand is low.

 This flexible load is what made most of the green energy project viable in the US and could help with a lot of new projects. 

Bitcoin mining is currently making green energy a profitable venture by buying the energy that they couldn't sell nor store.

b) Powell has no clue how to fix the USD debt issue because the options are to raise interest rates or do what they normally do and just renege on the tapering.

Also as a miner myself. I invested a boat load of cash on my property in solar and a small wind turbine to produce enough power to run my rigs for 16 out of the 24 hours they run.  
  
I pay roughly £2 a day for my miners which is no more than a single load of washing and then dried.  
  
I spent an awful amount of energy before investing in solar but I know if mining dies out my house hold energy bill would be free with a surplus which unfortunately I can't even sell back to the grid because of ""install reasons""  
  
PoS is few whales controlling the network which fine dosnt harm the environment but causes a trust issue.  
PoW is not controlled by 1 person altho miners can all ""pool"" together as one but if they go down others will take their place without any issues.  
Gipping cards for ""gamers"" only caused further issues since 1 card able to mine at 120mh now mines at 60mh meaning a miner would buy double the cards for the same speed causing further shortages and higher energy usage.",1642712034.0,0

Is he wrong? Is Cardano broken in some fundamental way?

> ETH is distinguishable here because Vitalik did not denigrate Cardano for releasing products in a rush that were in a broken state.

Vitalik infamously said he wants to ""move fast and break things"" with Ethereum. That's great. For a testnet. Not a mainnet. Right up until the point where billions of other people's dollars are at risk to be exact. That's the point. Running experiments with other people's money is fundamentally problematic. Is that really such a difficult concept to grasp? How is he wrong for pointing that out?

> With regard to rollups, the issue is whether modular blockchain architecture was valuable in the first place. For years Cardano community members did not acknowledge the need for modular blockchain architecture (read: the need for L2s) and how a modular approach helps scale. Only now, in 2021-2022 is Charles admitting that monolithic chains are unworkable.

You're dead wrong about everything you just said. Go back to his original whiteboard video. Cardano has been designed from the outset to be completely modular with not only composable L2s but hybrid proofs (POW/POA/PO-whatever) sidechains on Cardano integrated. I don't know where you got any of this but it is 100% wrong.

Let's be clear here: it is Ethereum which was extremely late to the L2 game. There's a reason that every single L2 solution on Ethereum was NOT built by Ethereum itself: it has had to all be done by third parties. Vitalik thought he could scale Ethereum with sharding, but it turns out that using an account model which depends on global state knowledge is almost impossible to scale with sharding because each of those shards is continuously changing that global state. (It can be done but would require a completely centralized base to keep track of global state as the shards change it. So you can either have decentralization or sharding using Ethereum, not both. That's why Cardano was built using eUTxO rather than Ethereum's account model. eUTxO doesn't require global state knowledge at all.)

> People’s main problems with Charles can be summarized as such: he damages other project’s credibility with the above claims, and when it turns out those he criticized had a good point, he does not acknowledge it.

2119,CryptoCurrency,a Cardano Roadmap - /CC style,aTalkingDonkey,1642687708.0,364,688,0.84,">Is he wrong? Is Cardano broken in some fundamental way?

You misunderstand the point. Here: ""The issue is that Charles repeatedly denigrated other projects for releasing products in broken states."" Having a product in a broken state does not preclude it from being fundamentally sound; **what** is broken matters the most. For instance, if Cardano released a wallet that had a broken UI but one could still interact with it just fine on the back end, then there is no fundamental flaw with that broken wallet. There was simply some developer oversight that can be remedied.

**However**, I am going to cite [the Sundaeswap whitepaper here](https://sundaeswap.finance/papers/SundaeSwap-2021-06-01-Fundamentals.pdf), because they do make a case exposing a fundamental issue with eUTXO:

>\[Page 7:\]  In the UTXO model, money is tracked as a chain of custody, by pointing at a specific (unspent) output from a previous transaction, which then gets consumed as the input to a new transaction. . . The **model used by Cardano extends this** in the following ways:  
>  
>• The UTXO is equipped with an arbitrary datum• The script locking the funds has access to input data, known as the“redeemer,” as well as the entire transaction . . .

&#x200B;

>\[Pages 8-9\]: A minting policy allows tracking tokens to be minted so long as the appropriate liquidity is deposited  
>  
>• The same minting policy allows tracking tokens to be burned so long  
>  
>as the appropriate liquidity is withdrawn  
>  
>• The validator script allows swaps to occur, so long as they respect the  
>  
>pricing function and fee structure . . .

&#x200B;

>\[Page 10\]: This model, however, has a fatal flaw. **Because any given eUTXO can only be spent once, as part of one transaction, it appears as if only one swap can happen per block. On the Cardano blockchain, there is roughly one block every 20 seconds.** This would be abysmal throughput for a decentralized exchange. We will discuss **the SundaeSwap scaling solution** in a future whitepaper.

First, under SundaeSwap's analysis, because Cardano in its eUTXO model **extends** this UTXO concept: ""\[M\]oney is tracked as a chain of custody, by pointing at a specific (unspent) output from a previous transaction, which then **gets consumed** as the input to a new transaction,"" that feature is embedded in Cardano.

Because the Cardano team embedded that flawed UTXO concept in Cardano's eUTXO model, Sundaeswap needed to implement their own workaround to address that embedded flaw in Cardano's eUTXO. Compare this issue, which what I claim is a fundamental flaw, to this hypothetical flaw:

>For instance, if Cardano released a wallet that had a broken UI but one could still interact with it just fine on the back end, then there is no fundamental flaw with that broken wallet. There was simply some developer oversight that can be remedied.

Unlike that example above, where the broken UI was not representative of a back-end issue, *here*, the swap limitations of Cardano *are* representative of a back-end issue. That back-end issue is exactly what SundaeSwap described:

>This model, however, has a fatal flaw. Because any given eUTXO can only be spent once, as part of one transaction, it appears as if only one swap can happen per block. On the Cardano blockchain, there is roughly one block every 20 seconds.

Because Cardano's eUTXO swap issue is not a mere front-end issue, I argue that it is a fundamental flaw, **which is in agreement with SundaeSwap's own whitepaper.**  Therefore, in spite of Cardano's emphasis on using peer-reviewed research to ensure correctness upon release, Cardano managed to launch a product with a fundamental back-end issue that forces developers to do workarounds. Simply put, this move by Cardano did **not** result in correctness upon release. Any fixes that come after will mirror exactly what you cited Vitalik does: to ""break things"" along the course of development.

Further, regarding the following:

>You're dead wrong about everything you just said. Go back to his original whiteboard video. Cardano has been designed from the outset to be completely modular with not only composable L2s but hybrid proofs (POW/POA/PO-whatever running as sidechains on Cardano) integrated. I don't know where you got any of this but it is 100% wrong.

I admit, I'm mistaken about Cardano's stance on modular architecture. They deserve credit for adopting the modular approach. However, [you are also mistaken about the composability of ETH rollups](https://polynya.medium.com/addressing-common-rollup-misconceptions-eba9d758707e):

>**A rollup remains fully composable,** even if it’s settled across multiple data shards or external data availability sources.  
>  
>Further, we have the possibilities of internally-sharded rollups that can come resolve to a single composable state with a single proof.  
>  
>Like L1s are not composable with each other, so are rollups systems not composable with each other. But there are many interoperability solutions live like Hop, Connext, cBridge and Biconomy, and many more in the works. **Indeed, there’s amazing innovations like dAMM that lets multiple zkRollups share liquidity! In addition, eventually we can have internally sharded zk rollups which retain full synchronous composability — a feat nigh impossible on L1s.**  
>  
>Tl;dr: Rollup composability is superior to L1s.

Overall, I know you're invested in the Cardano community, and for that reason I advise you to diligently read the whitepapers of dApps launching there. Particularly those of the DEXs, because they will all have to address this specific issue with Cardano's eUTXO, and it's important you know their method so you can see whether it sacrifices decentralization/security for speed.",1642706655.0,4

Take the Nasdaq Composite which is valued at $19.4 trillion total market capitalization. A 20% drop would wipe out nearly $4 trillion in total value. Now BTC is sitting at roughly $800 Billion total capitalization so that lost value is 5 times larger than the highest valued cryptocurrency.

Another thing to note is the volatility difference. 20% swings in value are extremely rare in the traditional markets. More akin to black swam events and massive economic instability. In BTC crypto in general that's a completely different story and more the norm.

He doesn't.

MicroStrategy made -7 million dollars last year.

They're a failing enterprise software company with a CEO who decided to YOLO the company treasury and billions of debt into bitcoin. They will have to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in interest over the next 7 years, which I can't think is going to help their struggling companies fortune.

[Saylor previously got fined millions of dollars for lying about his companies revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Saylor#SEC_investigation) which he used to pump and dump the share price.

The only compliment that can be paid to Saylor is that he was smart enough to take on this debt with convertible notes. Which means either Bitcoin continues to moon and Saylor gets rich and can pay off the billions in debt he's accrued, or if it doesn't and Microstrategy continues to fail at being a software company, then he can just convert the notes to shares in MicroStrategy, which will now be worthless because they will have billions in debts they can't pay off.

If from 2012 to present, you limit bought at 50% of all-time high, and sold with 70% trailing stop losses, you're now holding 2.8 Bitcoin.

Note that Bitcoin volatility is probably going down, so the numbers would need to be adjusted slightly here to work going forward. But this is an example of a strategy that is *so easy a caveman could do it™* and with more nuanced strategies you can probably do even better.

The problem is, a value store that routinely loses 60% of its value in a few months *is a shit store of value*, and if you're actually trying to make money off of it, your first priority should be plugging that enormous leak. HODLing is genuinely a crap strategy.",1642623181.0,3

In WoW, Blizzard devs create everything and you can't own a piece of real estate, you only have gear and random items associated with your character.

In a separate imagined metaverse, you can own the ""deeds"" to a particular plot and build a house, like MineCraft. That is yours, you own it. Now perhaps the rules are anyone can come in and destroy it, just like IRL, but there are the equivalent of police. You ruin someone's hard work and you have a bounty on your head. OR ... Homes are indestructible, who cares, it's whatever the rules of that metaverse are.

What's the point? Imagine WoW where nerds can buy up properties, create guilds and fortresses to defend against others... Users who can literally create items as NFTs but within the confines of certain hard-coded rules (maybe you need to gather some extremely rare and expensive shit to craft said weapon to make it even worthwhile). Then you sell the item that you spent months gathering materials for and crafting, but the contract attached to the NFT kicks back a small % of each sale to Blizzard and a small % to you as the person who crafted it. Now imagine that those NFTs have a valid worth associated with them and you have a ""net worth"" tied to digital items that you can leverage for loans within this metaverse. Or, say, you sell shit for crypto and you have another metaverse you're active in and you transfer the funds there.

Now let's talk about sex. Say WoW and orcs and elves aren't your thing, but you want to dip into a metaverse dedicated to hentai n shit. Same rules might apply. Maybe you're a digital pimp and you have the **ass*ets to sell desperate incels to get their rocks off. Same thing, NFTs. Maybe they are time-based and you only get it for 24hrs, a rental. Now say you want to bang an elf. Enter WoW-like sex-based metaverse.

On the flip side, there's another metaverse that mimics real life. Imagine the Sims metaverse. You can play house and have the perfect family, simulated via AI or some shit, so you feel like you are actually falling in love with this ""wife"" (or husband) of yours. Say you cannot get over someone and you obsess over them, this might allow you to recreate them and spend time with them. Toxic and unhealthy, for sure, but someone can get some money out of you for recreating a fantasy world. Same rules apply, you buy property, and perhaps to increase realism, you have the ability to drive into town and interact with other real people alongside AI/NPCs.

I highly recommend the Netflix show Upload. It's basically what I described except for an afterlife (you don't come back to the real world).

Black Mirror had TWO episodes about metaverses (essentially) - San Junipero and the one where the Bros make out.

Metaverses allow you to live a different life and choose who you want to be and choose who you interact with.

Yes, and they sort of did with WoW (granted I haven't played that since my 3 month free trial expired in 2007ish) where you could auction items in a marketplace for silver and gold pieces as their currency. A cryptocurrency makes it less about in-game gold and now gives you a currency you could technically go to a nearby store and use to purchase items, or be able to go between different Microsoft metaverses/games and still hold value. You don't technically NEED it to be crypto, it can be a centralized currency like Robux or a loaded Starbucks card, but crypto would help with interoperability.

NFTs are essential to giving ownership and allowing resales. Back in the Diablo 1 and 2 days, items could be duplicated, they never got a hold on that. Blockchain prevents duplicate transactions through an agreed-upon ledger (confirmations that the item is legit).

Edit: basically, crypto and NFTs are not NECESSARY but add value. The real kicker with NFTs is their ability to kick back a % of sales to the NFT creator, creates an economy and ecosystem wherein the original creator (Blizzard, Microsoft, etc) keep getting a cut while users take advantage of a marketplace. You'll have Chinese farmers accounting for 90% of the items sold, and someone with a $100k salary buying these $90 weapons and armor and upgrades because it's their sole hobby (gaming).",1642695679.0,5

That's a fault in the minting process security, as they are not duplicates.

That's like saying you can print thousands of $100 bills - they're serialized, among other features, but now add in the fact that the serial number must pass through checks as it's used or in circulation, instead of being handed from person to person. Imagine, instead of being handed a $100 bill, it must be slid through a scanner to verify it is a 1 of 1 or the serial number is valid, and if it's phony, the other side of the scanner is a shredder that destroys it immediately.

Now you COULD issue new editions of the same NFT, but it's still completely separate from the original. You could make the new edition slightly altered so it's identifiable/distinguishable from the 1st edition, or you can release a valid duplicate of the original intentionally.

Ex: you sell 10 of something, very desirable item, very rare. It's worth $10,000 for each unique (serialized) copy of this item. 2yrs later you release 1,000 more of them. Nothing indistinguishable except serial number. Now it's probably worth $200 because of it being diluted so heavily, lost the scarcity (sucks for original 10).",1642705646.0,1

There’s a lot of fantastic art on the blockchain - don’t look at shitty 10K collections and think they’re art. Look at real artists and art. 

BUT - Most established NFT collections don’t exist for the “art”. They’re means to an online identity, they’re access tokens to in real life events, they’re memberships to a DAO with a collective treasury that’s owned by the people, they’re items in play-to-earn games, and so many more things, but importantly, their functions can always be updated and expanded upon.

I agree that having a digital system for transferring and authenticating tickets is useful. But why does it have to be decentralized? Couldn't the issuer of the ticket just be the centralized record keeper? Like an NFT network with only one node?

> In cases where the resale of tickets is forbidden, NFTs can be developed as non-transferrable, not to be moved to another buyer physically.

You can't enforce that because crypto can only store virtual information. It knows nothing about the real world and there's nothing you can do to prevent someone from physically giving someone else the key.",1642637320.0,28

I started a Reddit sub on this theme as I think it deserves one. The tech needs to be explored and discussed from different angles. We use post flair for that in r/NFTTickets. 

I think it is safe to say say that NFT Tickets is not for everyone (both from an enduser perspective as from a service user perspective).

It really depends on what goals you are pursuing. 

- are you looking a for a long term engagement?
- is financing a problem 
- is scalping a risk, and what is your attitude against it
- are perpetual revenues an option and desirable
- is transparency an issue / trust
- is it important to know who holds a ticket, even long term
- is Proof of attendance important?
- etc 

The more boxes you check, the more attractive this tech becomes, as if seems efficient and effective at the same time. 

To make it a success the user experience needs to be spot on. Endusers should not know that is is blockchain that served them.

And, It could still be attractive to use from an economic perspective. When this tech turns out to deliver ticketing services at a lower cost per ticket (when compared to other solutions), you might still choose to use it (being sure the UX and UI are good).",1642667508.0,5

Artist don't like that their $50 ticket is sold for $200 and they don't get to realize the extra money.  I've actually listened to podcast where music industry people and artists talk about the stuff.  The complaint is never that you're getting scalped, it's that you get scalped and they can't benefit.  That some idiot priced this ticket at $50 when it damn well should have been priced at $200 cuz that's what people pay for it.  The market is dictating that they're a $200 ticket act but the label doesn't have faith in them.

NFT ticketing isn't going to be a godsend for consumers outside of not buying fake tickets imo.  Maybe some no name indie band who is really up on technology is going will mandate all this pro-consumer stuff but I doubt it'll be the norm.

Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber... they won't.  They'll just build a royalty in on any resale.  They're going to say this is a ""free market"" and use terms like ""price discovery"" and ""fair value"" when their tickets are resold for 5x face value and they're getting a beautiful slice of that pie.

Let's say, that you design these tickets to be smart contracts that can only be sold once from the original vendor, and cannot bet resold. So a scalper buys all of them up immediately after they go on sale, but they can't be resold, right? WRONG! They, can't be resold ON THE BLOCKCHAIN. But, nothing is stopping the scalper from selling the ENTIRE WALLET containing the ticket to somebody else, for cash.

You could argue that you could have names built into the smart contracts, so that you'd have to know the name of the attendee when the ticket is bought, preventing scalping. But this would only be enforceable if you had each person's ID checked at the door. But by that point, you might as well just sell tickets with names on them through a centralized system - no need to do it through the blockchain.

I guess this gets into what you mean by ownership. Whether a ticket is ultimately honored falls entirely to the event host. If the event host doesn't honor the ticket, you don't get in to the event, regardless of what the blockchain says. That's inherently centralized. All that matters is that the event host has a record of ticket sales & transfers. Why does it matter then if the record keeping process is centralized or decentralized?

> It also allows for programming conditions natively within them (eg. only be sold for the price it was bought for).

Doesn't require a decentralized network.

> Users digitally own their ticket as they would a physical ticket, and have the ability to list & transfer to another individual without the use of a middle man (cough ticketmaster).

This can already be done by the host. As far a I know the only reason they don't is because they don't feel like running their own server. (Though, I rarely go to concerts so feel free to inform me of other logistical issues.)

> There could be a centralized recorder, but imagine being able to see the whole network of people who attended the concert with you - lots of good loyalty & networking ideas there.

But first you need to make a million dollars. 

Second, you can’t touch it. 

Third you only get 50k in income and have to somehow live on that even though you’re technically a millionaire. And you have to pay taxes on that 50k. 

Fourth, your life is **completely** dependent on the crypto market. If the coin you’re staking goes down from $1.10 to 0.98, you have completely lost all of the staking income you’re going to make this year and more. 

The value of the actual asset you’re holding and how it changes will completely eclipse any staking income you make. Staking is just a nice little bonus while you hold a coin you believe in, but it is not an eternal way to generate passive income and live.

Get around 2.5million USD if you're living somewhere in America.

Get around 1million worth of fiat if you're living elsewhere in cheaper countries.

Put all in a stable coin or whatever coin you can make 9% to 20% APY. 

Live off of 4 or 5% of that a year, reinvest the rest back in to rise with inflation levels.

Remember 2.5mil \* .04 is around 100k. So imagine you get out 100k a year salary from a job and pay some taxes on that when you take it out for the year. This is enough to live in most places in America pretty comfortable and still travel around over the year as long as you don't spend your money on anything for luxury or aren't a big spender... and don't need to buy a house/car still or any big purchases.

A 10000% APR/APY  on some garbage coin or token that tanks in value isn't worth anything.....50,000 tokens a month that are worth 10c is livable, but if the price crashes to 0.001.....🤷‍♂️

You have to get in early and big and thats risky.

Everyone here wants that 1000% or 10,000% moonshot, but you have to put real money at risk to actually live off that

Youd have to put up a couple 100k to do it in a *safeish"" way, 20% is a great yield but 20% of a 100 dollars is 20 dollars.....a year. 20% of a 100k is 20k...still not enough to live off of (in the developed world) 

You're talking real money....even in a low income country, you might be able to live off a 1000 a month but to get that from a 10-20% stake payout you still need 10-20k...which is just as hard to come by in a low income place as a 100-200k is in a high income place....its all relative 

Idk......even if some of the irons I have in the fire turn up roses and the staking tokens I have would be worth say 30c-$1 I still wouldn't stop working because you are still super exposed to all the market and other forces that dictate the price of what you're paid in.....too risky for this guy lol",1642705953.0,1

Say you have a million dollar portfolio in stocks and a safe withdrawal rate is 4%. Yes, you are a millionaire and that means essentially for the rest of your life you can pull in 40k a year to live. 

This part is up to how strongly you believe in the market, but if you factor in any price appreciation at all from current levels the fact that you are generating 5-6% from an asset class that has the potential to double/triple/quadruple etc over your investing time horizon it is actually fairly easy to stake and live off the income. However you are giving up the compounding effect of the interest. 

Also staking means different things to different people. If he’s talking about good old fashioned POS staking then yes in the real world that’s impractical due to lock-up periods etc. But if you’re talking about yield farming/lending/providing liquidity you can live off of the gains from that very easily with not that much capital, it’s just higher risk of your funds being exposed.

5510,CryptoCurrency,"Making a living off staking crypto, is it possible?",ChoppedNSkrewed,1642674852.0,547,169,0.88,"Definitely. Reason 4 is the hugest problem. Really, this boils down to the right and wrong ways/reasons to stake.

The wrong way: You see Stakecoin with a price of $2 paying 10% APY and think ""Wow! Free money!"" So you spend 10k buying yourself 5000 Stakecoins figuring this should get you almost $20/week of free money.

But you're not the only person who knows about Stakecoin. Millions of people are doing this. So after the first week, the Stakecoin price is down to 1.80. Because lots and lots of coins get put into circulation increasing supply. Plus a lot of people sell them right away, putting sell pressure on the price. So sure, you made about $18 of staking income this week, but the value of your initial investment is down to $9000. So you have $9018 instead of your initial 10k.

You hold figuring this is just a dip. The price of Stakecoin goes up, down, crabs, but over the next three months slowly trends down to 1.60. So now you have about $8050. This free money from staking is really paying off, huh?

Then the bear market crash happens and Stakecoin goes to 10 cents and never comes back.

The right way: You research Investmentcoin and it looks like this is going to be a long-term highly useful coin and a great investment that you do not intend to sell or profit on except in the long term. You also notice that it's paying 10% staking rewards. You have no intention of trying to live on these rewards, just using them to help you accumulate more.

So you buy 5000 investment coin for 10k. You sit on it. It goes up, it goes down, it goes sideways. You don't care. At the end of a year, you have 5500 investmentcoin. There's a big bear market crash. You don't care. You sit on it. At the end of four years. the market starts to come back. At this time, you have about 7020 Investmentcoin.

In the bigger bull market 4 years from now, Investmentcoin hits a new high of $4. So your initial 10k is now worth 20k, plus the extra 2000 Investmentcoin you got from staking is worth another 8k. So you turned 10k into 28k. A nice 8k bonus from that staking, but the bulk of your profit is still the value of the underlying asset.

Staking APY doesn't change the rules of crypto: Pick a good asset that goes up in value over time, buy it low, and sell it high. Staking is sprinkles on the sundae, but if the ice cream melts, you just have soup.",1642692457.0,3
5511,CryptoCurrency,"Making a living off staking crypto, is it possible?",ChoppedNSkrewed,1642674852.0,547,169,0.88,"True, but the OP wants to live on his staking interest (which means selling his staking rewards every month instead of stacking the coin).

If you're buying an investment asset hoping it goes way up in value, staking is just the cherry on top. If your asset is worth 10x as much in 5 years, the huge majority of your profits are from the appreciation of your individual asset, plus a little extra bonus from the extra coins you got from staking. If your asset goes way down in value, you've lost lots of money, and the fact that you have a small amount of staking rewards to cushion the loss a tiny bit won't matter.

So staking or not, the main rule of crypto still applies: Pick a good coin that will actually go up in value, buy low, sell high. If there happens to be staking, great.",1642692730.0,1
5512,CryptoCurrency,"Making a living off staking crypto, is it possible?",ChoppedNSkrewed,1642674852.0,547,169,0.88,"Staking is still a very good thing, used properly. Just remember the main rule of crypto: You are buying an investment asset that has utility and is likely to go up long-term, holding it, and selling it at a higher price.

Instead of trying to buy an income-generating asset and trying to live off of the income, recognize that staking is peanuts, and the real profits come from buying an investment asset that goes up in value. Staking is just an added bonus.

For example, if I buy 1000 coins of something that sucks but pays 50% APY, thinking I'll get free money every week, in a month, the price of that 1000 coin is going to dump because millions of other people just like me are holding the coin, getting staking rewards, and selling right away creating a lot of sell pressure and dumping the price - and as soon as there's some new site with a high APY, everyone cashes out and chases the new APY and the price of this one craters.

But if I buy 1000 coins of something that might actually go up long-term, that maybe has a boring modest 5% staking reward, and I just sit on it for ten years and ignore what the price does, I'll have 1550 coins in ten years. If this coin has doubled in price in 10 years, I've tripled my initial investment instead of just doubling it thanks to the staking rewards I've been getting.

Buying good crypto that goes up in price long term is the #1 thing to do. But using staking if it's available to help you stack more of a good crypto is a good thing.",1642703690.0,1

The number of people staking UST for 19.5% far, far, FAR outpaces the number of people borrowing and paying for it. The big Terra network guy has put a lot of money, out of pocket, to fund Anchor and serve as a safety net, but in a few years, that 20% is going way, way down when Anchor gets low on cash and can't keep paying out rewards in excess of the people paying them interest to borrow money.

Further complicating the issue is that UST is an algorithmic stablecoin. Its $1 peg is maintained using the burning and minting of Luna and arbitrage trading. If the market has a real crash (not these little fuddy duddy dips, but an actual bear market oh shit bitcoin just went down 80% crash) and Luna trading volume goes down significantly, UST will not maintain its $1 peg and people will lose a lot of money.

Anchor protocol is not a risk-free free lunch where you stake stablecoins for insane interest forever. It is a riskier play than conventional staking, for a temporary 3-4 years of high APY before the rate goes way down and everybody jumps ship.",1642715377.0,1

If those investments are in a portfolio that is 60% stocks/40% bonds, you can withdraw 3-4% per year; at that rate, you can have the same income each retirement year after adjusting for inflation, and have a >80% chance of having the money last a 30 years. Your $2.5M might give a lifestyle more like $75-100k.

But, that's all based on past performance of stocks and bonds. I think crypto is still up in the air. The 4% rule assumes like 7% yield for the fixed income portion. Will staking rewards and DeFi protocols always pay what they pay today? Will crypto assets still appreciate like crazy over the next 30-40 years?

There is always the DeFi risk which I think is still somewhat higher than regular legacy finance. But these are the safest options I know in crypto.

You can probably google this quite easily, but in essence, you put a certain amount of two arbitrary tokens in a smart contract, and then let other users swap between the two, like a substitute for an order book. This is neat because now we don't need to pair both buyer and seller to perform a trade, and so it's called an Automated Market Maker (AMM). To give incentive for people to provide liquidity, the contract will take a fee on each trade and reward it to the liquidity providers. (The first successful and probably most famous example of this is Uniswap). In addition to this, we have Yield Farms that will give you an arbitrary amount of their token just for picking their pool. (Well known example: PancakeSwap).

A ""stable-LP"" pair is simple an LP where both the tokens are stablecoins. This can be USDC-USDT, USDC-DAI, DAI-UST, whatever. Because both tokens in the pair are stablecoins, we expect them to stay very *stable* in price, which reduces the risk of Impermanent Loss (which you should also quickly google if you are going to delve into providing liquidity), so we expect the pair to be a relatively ""safe"" investment as far as crypto is concerned. 

Now, there are legit reasons to trade between 2 different stablecoins, so these pairs will often see some volume, and therefore be able to generate some fees. Top this of with a Yield Farm and you can get pretty decent APRs with *relatively* low risk. 

Finally, I did try this, and it's working like a charm so far. The gains match the calculations pretty well, and it ticks in rather steadily. The only problem is that I don't have enough cash to make a living of a 12% APR.",1642683716.0,9

5609,CryptoCurrency,"Making a living off staking crypto, is it possible?",ChoppedNSkrewed,1642674852.0,547,169,0.88,"This is the case on any site. The general formula is there are a bunch of liquidity pools, and you are incentivized to put coins into the pools with a high APY *that is paid to you in the form of a token specific to the site you are using*.

There is always at least one, and sometimes more than one, pool for the token the site rewards you with, and those always have high APYs to try to incentivize people to not just dump the token by instead keep it around to try to get even more yields.

The thing is, smart yield farmers always sell off the farm coin, because farm coins always eventually dump. It doesn't matter if the farm coin also functions as a governance coin or a staking coin. Yield-farmers always sell the farm coin because farm coins always eventually dump. Osmosis tries to head this off by requiring a 2-week lockup period for the maximum APY.

If there were no external rewards and all of the APYs were fairly comparable, I'd probably enter into LPs where I like *both* assets (like an Atom/Luna or Atom/UST or Luna/UST pool), and not a pool where one of the assets is Osmo or one of the assets is a squirrely little-known Cosmos airdrop asset I've never heard of.

Then just sell my daily osmo rewards for more of the coins I actually want and add those to the pool.

But if you're getting a *much* bigger APY, plus an external reward for one of the osmo pools, it's maybe worth a little risk if the external reward is a coin you actually want, like Luna and not some fad dog coin or some colorful star coin.",1642703151.0,1

Further work included implementation of the LLMQs, intra-quorum relay connections, single probe-only DMN connections, the DMN peers cache and metadata module, the protection of verified MN connections from eviction while they are part of the active quorum, the capability of sending interest in plain LLMQ recovered sigs - the network gossiped result of the distributed key generation protocol, which is the decentralized protocol based on BLS-signatures and Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme that allows the creation of a shared key-pair from M-of-N DMNs that is going to be part of the new blockchain consensus. Technical details can be found on GitHub. What comes further is the LLMQ sessions state machine, which basically is the protocol orchestrator and the core of the distributed key generation protocol.If you are still wondering why all these developments matter? Because its masternode network is going to be the backbone of the new KYC-free decentralized exchange, where PIVX's instant shielded transactions will be used for a medium of exchange between BTC, ETH and other coins in a completely anonymized way. Furthermore, work on the zero-knowledge NFTs and zero knowledge Smart Contacts is coming next.Interesting developments indeed from a very small project if you ask me. I suggest you to do your own research. It might be ready for an explosive 2022 for this project if they deliver all they are saying, let's see.

It doesn't need to be high-end (using a 1050, for example, would still be much faster than a CPU), the data you're training on and the size of your model is the biggest factor, because it determines how much memory you need.

Edit: To clarify, it's possible to train on CPU, but if you're working on the model, you're going to go through a lot of training, (using different model graphs, data preprocessing, etc...), so it's very time consuming. You train a lot because each time you want to try any changes or improvement to the model, you go through more training. If you got lucky and built a perfect model on the first try, you would only need to train once, but you wouldn't know it was the best model unless you trained some other ones that weren't as good, to prove your first model was the best.

The difference between CPU / GPU is about an hour of CPU training for every 5 minutes on a GPU.

The FDIC has some models and resources for doing that on a simple scale like you want to do. 

Across many banks, look at the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of a bank, along with the weightings used for those ratios from the official documentation. These ratios were designed to help measure a bank’s resilience to a bank run scenario based on a 2008-ish liquidity crisis. With the way the LCR is designed, no covered bank should run out of liquid funds within 30 days. And if liquidity gets so bad that banks are running out of funds, the central bank is certain to intervene with cash today.

Trying to predict a bank run is difficult, and if you are trying to build a trading algorithm based on that you have to consider: how stale is my deposits data for this bank going to be? At what point would the bank’s securities become price-sensitive to this fundamental condition? At the times where bank run risk matters, is this going to be a priced factor for just one bank or a systemic event that shocks all security prices?",1642342433.0,51

However, LCR only tells us the **minimum amount** required by law for a bank to keep at hand as liquid funds at any point in time. And, as you stated it is a constant ratio.

I am trying to build a statistical model that will predict the amount of funds to keep as liquid funds so that if the previous patterns of historical withdrawals and deposits were to continue, there would be a low probability that liquid funds would be exhausted. This, in fact would not account for a black swan bank run type scenario because in those cases, the withdrawal activity might spike, which will not be accounted for in the model.

Since all banks need to have a LCR > 100%, it’s a much higher threshold than the amount of funds needed to keep liquid for historical withdrawal rates. Because the LCR was designed based off of historical data, satisfying the LCR means the probability of a bank running out of funds based on *historical* withdrawal rates like you want to model will be zero.

Perhaps I don’t understand why you are going to the effort to model something we already know the answer to. Are you trying to use this to predict a bank failure? Do you want to trade bank equity with this model? How much effort do you want to put in to a model that doesn’t give you actionable information?

1. Cluster like with like data (i.e. similar new headlines, sec filings, etc.). This would involve some level of NLP in order to properly parse this data and find it's ""similarity score"" with other data --> look into search algorithms for help. Vector search is a good place to start if you are looking for a very technical solution.
2. Use survival analysis on each of the clustered categories from step 1. This will tell you how strong any given signal is and in general what the survival curve of each signal (clustered category) will look like. This step is very relevant if you are looking to parse news, as this data can be very difficult to separate the useful information from the noise. 
3. The final step is to try to find a lead-lag relationship between the modeled out data from step 2 and any underlying asset(s) you find are related to this data. 

For example, you can parse a bunch of pubic filings (10-Q, 8-K, Forms 3, 4, 5, etc.) for a particular stock (extra both numerical information as well as the language use in each filing) and see how the language changes in each filing relative to how the numbers of each file changes. Then try to find if this data has any relationship with the target underlying stock (i.e. a lead-lag relationship of sorts). That is how you can start doing ""quantamental"" analysis.

I would guess you could take many, many instances of companies releasing this info and assume all other factors produce some random noise around the price; then see if you can find a consistent signal pulse at the time of earnings release.

However, it is very possible market understanding changes in a non-random way overtime. Maybe in 1999 every earnings rallied +X% anyways regardless of misses; maybe in 2001 every earnings sold off regardless.

I’m just thinking out loud now, but maybe there is research in signal processing for finding a consistent signal under non-random noise. I’ll Google some and update with any interesting references I find.

Most of the systems created are about going long. Those have had an economic wind at their back... the market spends more time going up than going down. Create a long-biased system, throw darts at stock picks, and you'll find that the longs win over the shorts. They have to.

Systems that win for shorts are usually about identifying assets for which there is a reason to short. Crappy fundamentals in a stock. Sectors that are losers in the ever-turning economic cycle. Stocks going down have to do it long enough for the volatility skew to not eat the trade before you enter, which means you really need to identify a sustainable edge for the shorts. Hedge funds that do market-neutral strategies, that's what they are aiming for.

So yes, what you see is real. And it is older than likely any of us who trade in the market. Inverting to go short is a conceptual bias, it isn't an analysis of market behavior or security fundamentals that be exploited unless your system is designed to really be bidirectional.

I have producer threads for system inputs and one consumer thread.

Producers produce Quotes, Aggregates, Timeouts, RPC calls etc. These are all system inputs. They are placed on the consumer's threadsafe queue. This is pretty much a replication of asyncio, but I don't have to write async await everywhere and I don't have the mental overload of having to avoid mixing red/green functions.

Then I have a consumer (the main thread) which is of course blocking. This is good for debugging purposes. Once an event starts being consumed, the world stops so you know you can't have concurrency issues and you can do step by step debugging. The program doesn't jump all over the place.

If I have to handle an event in the main thread that requires CPU power, the first thing I try is to use one of the producers to calculate everything live. If that doesn't work, I use a multiprocess worker queue to offload the CPU work.

Edit:

Threadsafe Queues solve a lot of problems and avoid classes of bugs by virtue of existing.

For example: While using IB API, once IB disconnects for whatever reason, this event is sent to consumer's queue, consumer deallocates and reallocates the IB client and retries connecting cleanly. This way you avoid most locks and mutexes trying to make the IB thread clean up itself.

Queues also solve concurrency problems. You send/receive messages to/from your FIX Application in an orderly manner so that there is no chance of the first function call finishing after your second function call.",1642143599.0,24

While it might seem like a nightmare to debug a massively parallel system, that's only the case if you've included a lot of sychronization and blocking. A good parallel system is just executing the same stream of operations thousands or millions of times in parallel. So, if I see a log message that TSLA's stream had an exception, I can rerun the entire pipeline and set that as the single symbol being processed. I can then walk through the entire workflow in the same way you'd step through a single-process application. 

This is a similar approach to what you'd take for writing parallel code on the PS3 or your GPU and yes it does make things like look-back or cross-communications difficult. You end up having to structure your algorithms so that there's none of that, even if it means duplicating data into a process. You're trading memory for execution speed. This is definitely not the best approach for a beginner. I have a background in high performance and scalable computing so this makes sense.

If I was building smaller scale I'd probably work serially with as much async as possible but with the execution driven by an input that could be scaled (i.e., a really sleek single app with async calls that runs fast and the input is a list of symbols let's say). That way I could scale horizontally in the future by partitioning load by whatever the core dataset is (in this example, 1000 symbols per node or something). 

Scaling horizontally allows you to spawn a new node on your laptop, on a separate machine, or in the cloud that can all compute to their best ability without requiring that you rework any of your code or sychronize anything. Just spawn a node, give it symbols and a config, and boom it's off processing your algorithms and storing your results.

Storing results is always tricky once you scale out but that's a 5000 word post in and of itself -- NoSQL and eventual consistency can help out massively. I use key value stores and the threads insert into different partitions based on a symbol driven partitioning key scheme. That way, you get max throughput, inserting in-parallel and async, and avoid having multiple threads writing to the same partition.

Anyway, going off on a tangent, I could write all day about this, haha. Algo trading and the systems behind them are some of the most interesting, performant, and complex in the world.

This is by far the lowest priority out of everything, so for starters I would like to throw this either on a separate thread, or run StringWriter.WriteLineAsync to not cause blocking when producing output.  So this is the part that I am looking to optimize....  at least to start, I am sure there will be more.  Any specific advice would be helpful!",1642386945.0,1

6277,altcoin,Jacy looking juicy!,Monster1487,1642564131.0,29,21,0.74,"Thought I would take a stroll down shitcoin alley, its been a while.

I see nothing has changed, one webpage wonder that wont actually do anything useful until phase 4 ? and when is phase 4 ? I mean let's not confuse phases with quarters or was that the intention ? and if you keep going you can always kick that down the road, cant you ? Seen that tons of time and some app that has your webpage and ability to buy and see your balance is not an app. Where it the mock up of that ?

All this work, marketing, signing people up just for an NFT museum ?, in the scheme of things how hard is it to have built an NFT marketplace or have some kind of working model or part of one ?  and hey, I see you pumped and dumped once and its building back up or was that part of build up again ? Anyone who is passionate about something like this would have more than words.

and your contract ? it stunk before I gave it the smell test, better fixit up a little before certik looks at it: [https://tokensniffer.com/token/0x916c5de09cf63f6602d1e1793fb41f6437814a62](https://tokensniffer.com/token/0x916c5de09cf63f6602d1e1793fb41f6437814a62)

The interesting thing is that the new contracts stinks more then the old one:

0x08f2991a6eff2671cf791b82aeae64fbbfdd0633

[https://tokensniffer.com/token/0x08f2991a6eff2671cf791b82aeae64fbbfdd0633](https://tokensniffer.com/token/0x08f2991a6eff2671cf791b82aeae64fbbfdd0633)

Imagine that, you changed contracts because the other pumped and dumped ? Yet the new contract is full of rugpull holes.

So if you fix up the rugpull holes, Certik only audits the security and some possible code flaws but they dont verify what the program does, if its useful, if it actual does something. They passed a shit coin that was the equivalent of a metal cash box with a padlock on it.

Does anyone know what a white paper is anymore ? this has some vague pie in the sky ideas.

Your tokennomics is boilerplate from all the other shitcoins with reflections.

Where is your team doxed ? how about names and linked in profiles on the webpage ? What have they got to hide ?

Listing on CMC or coingeko means nothing, its no endorsement of anything, tons of shitcoins are listed.

But hey, dont worry, I have written emails like this before because I cared about people new to crypto getting ripped off. But I guess its greed that gets the better of them once they drank the kool-aid. 

I would be careful in your response,  I may never come back unless provoked. I poke my head in another shitcoin that managed to kick the can down the road 10 months and it still does nothing and people still believe. But because they jumped all over me, I made it a point of coming back once a month, today is that day, Shall I add you to the list ?",1642619544.0,3
