The bit about transmitting a block as just a list of transactions that everyone has already seen is done, I think Bitcoin Cash uses that but I could be wrong.

Also, I would be hesitant to map numbers of transactions to raw IO operations.  Part of the problem is that nodes want to build indexes of data (by address, by transaction, etc) and that involves messing with the database, which could involve several reads and writes for one change.  However, with careful flushing a lot can be staged in memory and lazy wrote latter or in big chunks.  (Example, only flush that a block is complete after all the writes are flushed, and if a block isn't marked as complete you have to redo some work on restart).

Your ""scaling solution"" is definitely feasible, but on the blockchain trillemma triangle, it heavily sacrifices decentralization for scalability. As you've admitted yourself:

> **Second SPV traffic.**

> SPV traffic is pretty easy to serve from a few high-performance nodes in datacenters. (...) Home users' full nodes can simply elect not to serve SPVV, and leave that part to businesses and miners. We professionals can handle the problem efficiently enough that the costs won't be significant, just as the costs per user aren't significant now.

That flies in direct contradiction to the core ethos of the blockchain tech itself: BTC **wants** hobbyists to run a full node. The whole reason why the blockchain exists is to prevent this kind of centralization. By increasing the block size to 1GB at our current level of tech, you're reintroducing the very thing that Satoshi wanted to get away from in the first place.

BTC, as part of its ideology, will never increase its block size under any circumstances (The block size wars occurred BECAUSE of vocal opposition against it, hence BCH & other forks). **EVEN IF** its viable, **EVEN IF** it makes sense, BTC **will** castrate you for even daring to go against the ""never increase block size"" doctrine.

>Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before
it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash,
transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree , with only the root included in the block's hash.
Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do
not need to be stored.
A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are
generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems
typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of
1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in
memory.


It's the utxo set that matters and eventually after world adoption has been reached the size of it will find a equilibrium where sometimes the set with decrease and sometimes it will increase.

SPV nodes are great for low end systems (eg. Mobile Phones) to make sure transactions involving the user are legit. However, SPV nodes need to trust other full nodes to provide truthful data in order to work. Importantly, SPV nodes can be fooled into thinking invalid transactions are real in the case of a 51% attack.

A full node requires more system power and storage space to full sync and keep track of the entire blockchain. Full node's don't need to trust any other peer since they are validating each transaction and block themselves.  


It boils down to how much you're willing to trust others when deciding what node to run. I personally, run a full node at home with my applications connected to said node so I don't need to trust other peers. So your proposed solution to making full node's only feasible to run on expensive machines is unacceptable from my perspective and many people would think the same as well.

You stated that you think online shopping would be a better experience with “blockchain and dApps being integrated to protect customers”. One could argue that integrating a blockchain will hurt customers, not protect them. For example, bob wants to buy a pair of shoes from a retailer.

Bob tries to checkout, but he accidentally clicked on a malicious link, and now his wallet is exposed and his money can be stolen. In the fiat system, the transaction can be reversed, bob will get his money back and will receive shoes in the mail. With crypto, bob lost his savings and he can only cry online about it.

&#x200B;

I think its a very serious problem, if you use a hardware wallet and go to a website and try to sign a transaction, you can't just trust metamask or the website when they display the information, as they could be hacked or it could be a phishing website or fake metamask wallet, the only solution is to display it via the hardware wallet.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, hw wallets like ledger (even the model X) have super tiny displays which make it a huge pain to view any of the contract data to verify the signing of transactions.

&#x200B;

The keystone hardware wallet (formerly cobo wallet) has a very good solution to this and is tackling the issue head on:

69,CryptoTechnology,Can you verify what you are signing for?,FestiveUnderground,1643199710.0,101,84,0.97,"The true answer is, it's difficult. In most cases before you sign, you can check out the data tab on MetaMask and verify that you are interacting with the right contract. You would need to use a block explorer to actually verify that the contract address is actually the one that you intended to connect to (See BadgerDAO frontend hack). In the data, it will say which function you are calling. If the project has its source code published, the HEX function might resolve to what they named it. Let's say the function is called VOTE. It would seem like you are VOTING on something. To know what's ACTUALLY happening, you would need to read what that function does. Maybe it's named VOTE, but the programming logic is a transfer. This would only happen on a malicious token. All mainstream token functions match their logic. This is all on the computer side.

Now when you go to sign a transaction on a HW wallet, you would need to re-verify the address, function hex, data hex, and make sure that a compromised MetaMask wasn't showing you one thing, and you are signing another thing. If all of that looks good then you can rest easy in signing that transaction. 

The more that it's streamlined, the more you would need to trust your system and setup. 

To clarify your exact question, when sending wETH, you would be interacting with the wETH ERC20 contract and allowing the swap dapp access to spend 0.001 ETH, this is called an allowance. If you stupidly ALLOWED it to spend more than you intended, that's on you. Your second transaction would be to call the SWAP function. The swap dapp would take wETH out of your wallet (because you previously allowed them to) and then they would give you the token or NFT that you swapped for. The apps that you approve spending access to technically have access to take funds from your account. The limit is that the smart contract MUST have the functionality to take your funds outside of the swap function. Since UNISWAP don't have a DRAIN\_USER function, it's kind of OK to allow them to have an allowance to some of your tokens. 

That's the gist of it. Most mainstream dapps are fine, just be weary of allowances, new dapps, and new tokens.",1643252611.0,7

The advantage of non fungible items in gaming is that it would be impossible for people to cheat the system. For example, you might have heard about the fifa scandal in which developers were selling rare collectibles “under the table”. This was possible since in regular systems you can simply go into the database and add/remove lines which will affect the players. This makes it hard to differentiate real earned rewards from cheated ones.

The same gun is also visible to people when you walk into certain virtual rooms in Facebook's MetaVerse or when you walk around Decentraland. It's both visible on your avatar, and people could see a list of inventory items you carry. I might click on your profile and see you carry:

Reebok pump vintage re-issue (white) - $100 - FOR SALE  
Gucci Sunglasses - $400  
Commemorative Plaque (Charity Donation to Save the Children) - $200  
X20 Assault Rifle (Compatible TF, CS, Doom, FortNite) - $20 - FOR SALE  
StarWars Fan Badge (Earned 2023)

Perhaps you buy the physical items like Nike Air Jordans in real life and you get the NFT free, or perhaps some items only exist as NFTs.

When you walk about the street wearing your Rebooks, if you meet someone who is wearing Augmented Reality Glasses they can see when you bought them, and they can also see your avatar is your StarWars badge.

Now, to my mind this takes an unimaginable amount of cross-compatibility coding, but I guess that's what standardised protocols are for - making things work everywhere? 

And the idea is that these items are stored across the decentralised blockchain, so if Gucci's servers crash or go out of business your sunglasses don't disappear.

That's the vision, whether it becomes a reality I don't know. Technology moves incredibly quickly when it's profitable and the public are enthusiastic about it.

The pros would be a free market and the possibility for games to use existing infrastructure for item and cosmetics management and possibly reduce burden on their servers.

In the simplest form, NFTs in gaming basically just enable ""real money auction house"", or in this case ""crypto auction house"". The main difference is that your items persist even after the game dies and the server gets shut down, at which point they take on the role of a collectible.

More advanced implementations include allowing players to ""port over"" items from previous games (imagine being able to use your legendary Diablo 3 items in Diablo 4, etc), or getting some starting advantage with Diablo 4 for having certain Diablo 3 items, and so on. The ""metaverse end game"" that we're looking at is for items to be usable even in other games (as skins or actual items), and for all your in-game items to become accessories that you can use to personalize your metaverse avatar. While this *can* be achieved without blockchain tech, it's just easier because you don't need to build everything from scratch. The standards and the marketplaces already exist. 

An alternative use for NFTs in gaming is for each copy of a game to be an NFT. That will remove the need for all other forms of DRM, and also enable a resale market (think of the old days where you could sell your Nintendo cartridge to a friend after you're done). And also give you the ability to prove ownership of a game across different platforms (steam, gog, epic games, etc) without having to buy a copy on each platform. Why will game companies allow this?

one of his two major points was that you can't force in-game items from one game into another (eg, using battlefield guns in call of duty or fifa players in PES) which is largely true for the most part. he completely avoids what is probably the best use-case for nfts in gaming which is ownership and on/off-ramps. 

if there is a  very rare skin in call of duty that is awarded to me for winning a tournament, nfts would provide an aveanue to sell this item outside the game. if it's awarded to you as an nft, you can take that nft, sell it on a marketplace to someone else who is unwilling or unable to win it on their own. in the past you would need to sell your account and risk getting banned (depending on terms of service) to get real money for this digital asset. 

account selling for specific in game items or players is very common in games such as fifa (specifically in their ultimate team mode where you buy fifa points to open packs of players). some pro footballers will spend 10's or hundreds  of thousands on building the best team possible each year. right now EA keeps all of that as there is no ""offramp"" selling your player for ingame coins.

The promise of NFTs is this:

- Ownership of items you purchase in-game. That means you can re-sell them to other players and recoup your money. The original developer can also retain a small commission on re-sales which is incredible for indie devs. 
- Items built for decentralized web 3 game engines (Unity and Unreal are popular web 2 engines) can be used cross game. So buy an item from a creator for ExampleGE and use it in any game that uses ExampleGE. 
- Rare items or unique one of a kind items from creators, indie devs, or artists. These might have a special design or special in-game properties. An NFT is a digital contract, so creators can verify that yes this item is the one I created (certificate of authenticity) and owners can prove ownership. 

I love the promise of NFTs and realize both sides of any new technology.

>im genuinely curious how NFTs in games are different or better from systems like the steam market for CS,TF2 and others

The biggest thing is that, this is exclusive to steam and steam only. Steam owns the backend, steam decides what goes on it, steam has total and complete control. When you factor in that it's *possible* to get banned for even modding a single player game. when I was looking to modernize KOTOR I had to modify the .exe and some guides mentioned a risk as it is explicitly against the TOS; will it happen? probably not, but it's a risk that exists and it would shut off all my access to the hundreds of games I've bought and any assets I owned in-game instantly.

The idea of using a blockchain, is now you have a steam marketplace type ecosystem, but it's not tied to any singular system since now the blockchain is just an accessible/usable resource on the internet. What that means is now you'd be able to have the steam marketplace but across platform, across games, etc. etc. and no singular entity would control it, meaning you have sole access to your assets.

I was just thinking yesterday how nice it would be if, for games I no longer play, I could do like I did with Dota 2 and sell all my digital goods on the steam market, but because it's on my playstation/xbox/etc. I can't do that. Using NFTs for those same digital assets and a public blockchain could make that possible. Even the idea of cross-platform assets would be much easier to implement using a public blockchain as opposed to having to create your own importing system from scratch like devs have to do now. Look at the nightmare that is the hitman trilogy porting content from one game to another.

Suppose that the following hard-and-possibly-infeasible problems had been solved:  

1) establishing a standard format for art assets for wearable items for characters, which is relatively easy to implement support for in games, and which somehow made it easier to use such art assets for characters of different dimensions  

(I really do think this one is probably infeasible)

2) (user friendliness of cryptocurrency stuff in a way that makes it difficult for people to scam people to get their keys and such?)

3) other problems I’m forgetting or haven’t thought of

and , I’m not sure if this next  one is an easy problem, or a hard/unsolvable problem:  

4) establish a kind of license for art assets such that license is granted to all games to use [art asset] for exclusively the purpose of it being worn by characters in association with holding the associated token, and have it established that this is a thing that a license can legitimately require (and enforce through civil courts and such (so, the license here would grant meaning to the token)

If all of these conditions were satisfied,  
well, it might still make more sense to use a shared centralized chain for this,

2. It is free to play and it is play to earn. It is NOT pay to play. There are many examples of free GU decks on the GU subreddit that have competed against the very best and most expensive decks. The benefit of this is you WIN rare and expensive cards.

3. Personally I have put in a few hundred dollars to buy chests to support the game. Recently a website that calculates card values of players have priced my collection at several thousand dollars. 

4. If I want I can sell these cards through the GU marketplace but also 3rd party marketplaces because I own the cards on the Ethereum blockchain. The game cannot set the values of the cards ensuring a free market economy for the cards.

5. The devs are responsive and constantly improving the game.

No one has ever given me a good reason why you wouldn't want to own the cards independently on the blockchain. This is the only way I see NFTs as valuable. Images of monkeys and Pixelated punks have no value but a card in relation to a game does have a lot of real world value and I have more ownership over the card than if I had it over a platform like steam. 

Yes, if the game disappears then the cards have no value, of course. But outside of that there really is no downside. It's been fun and easy money and does not feel like I'm being exploited. We all enjoy sinking countless hours into a game, it's just this one pays you to do it.",1643132248.0,6

An easier implementation would be to just have skins that can be transferred, with no effect on gameplay. Easier to imagine how to do this, but where’s the fun in it?

To really do this effectively, you’d need a standard cross-game-item protocol. For a shooter, such a protocol might have standards for type of gun, mag size, sights, upgrades, and so on. To make it look good in the game, there would be standards for location of the trigger, barrel, and sights - all relative to item holder’s hands, torso, and head. For the skins - well, you could have a preset standard selection of skins, or maybe you just allow some wacky looking skins in the game. As for game mode - maybe you have some standards there, after all it would be nice if such items were available in every game mode - but games wouldn’t need to support cross-game-items in every mode. 

This sounds super complicated (and it is!), but certainly not impossible, and I’m sure people will try it.

210,CryptoTechnology,Can someone explain to me NFTs in gaming?,Puddingwastaken,1643102292.0,254,93,0.93,"TCGs (and things sufficiently similar to TCGs) do seem to me like one of the more plausibly sensible ways to have something with a game-mechanics impact be tied to a tradable token, because:  

1) while devs needing to nerf an item for balance reasons might be more of a concern in many games (“if there’s a non-negligible chance that they will change what it does, do you really ‘own’ it?”), with TCGs, they can just change what cards are banned (or restricted) in what formats, instead of modifying “what the card does”. Admittedly, in many digital CCGs, devs do nerf (or buff) cards instead of limited or banning them, but banning and limiting is an option, and if you allow trading the cards, I think it would likely make sense for the devs to limit themselves to doing things via banning and limiting in some formats. (E.g. all the formats in which they run official tournaments.)  
In addition, if they wanted to do nerfs or buffs of cards without modifying existing cards, they could issue a new card, distributed to all people (or accounts) that currently hold the original version of the card, which is the nerfed or buffed version. (Perhaps these new cards could have, as part of their card text, a requirement that they can’t be in the same deck as the card that they are the nerfed/buffed version of, so that in the unlimited format, people who had one copy of a card that got nerfed wouldn’t suddenly have two similar cards to use in the same deck in the unlimited format.)

2) as you say, while people could certainly trade such cards in an online marketplace run by the devs of the game,  
the interface for things on blockchains with smart contracts, is rather general and allows people to set up their own ways of trading the relevant tokens,  
And, allowing players to use such a general interface could be nice (at least, provided that a simplified interface for the simple and straightforward ways of trading and buying/selling cards is also supported).  
Even the interface of smart contract systems doesn’t strictly require using an actual blockchain, but I’m unaware of any service which offers such an interface without at least claiming to use a blockchain? (I do think someone should make a setup to facilitate making such a service, but I’ve not seen any yet.)  

3) it being on an actual decentralized blockchain, or at least, a smart contract platform run by an independent organization for which the devs of the tcg don’t have an oversized influence, and which has no motivation to mess with the tcg, does allow the devs of the tcg to strongly commit to the whole “you can continue trading the cards regardless of whether we cease to develop the game, and we won’t change any of the cards per se, just ban them and issue nerfed versions, but you can play matches in a different format where whatever bans don’t apply, and it will still work in the program.”  

_______

I’m not sure whether it would make sense to do this on any real blockchain due to the amount of data needed to store so many card ownership relations? But maybe I’m underestimating the capacity of layer 2 stuff.  

But, this does seem at least worth trying to develop an extensible (future-proof) standard for how to represent cards for basically any kind of tcg implemented with this kind of setup, and such.  
Like, it should have a field for what game it is for (maybe this should include an indicator for what version of the rules?), some fields for things common to most TCGs (but most of these should be optional in case a TCG doesn’t have some), as well as an extra data section, for things specific to whatever TCG (e.g. voice lines).
Of course, all this data shouldn’t be included on chain, even if this was to be done with an actual blockchain. It would just be referenced with a hash (or, perhaps rather a multiaddress or multihash or whatever the right terminology is)

I think it would also make sense to have a standard where an id is made for a game, and an address (or addresses) associated to it as being able to issue cards for that game, but where another game could define itself as including any cards issued under the first game, as well as any issued under this one.  
This would have the benefits of, uh, well, a) if the devs mess up badly and lose their keys, it is easier for that to be fixed, as the format already supports just using the new version, and b) this facilitates fan extensions of the game, and fan-extensions of fan-extensions, etc.  

However, possibly rather than all that being part of a definition of the “game”, it should part of the definition of a “format”?  

Not sure.  

Again, not sure whether doing this on it an actual blockchain makes sense, maybe it could,  
but even if it takes too much data, it seems like it could at least be a cool thing to try on a “smart contract platform”.",1643661007.0,1

I think the main difference between using blockchain for accounting systems and using it for game items is that the accounting use case is already largely implemented.

The gaming use case has not been invented yet - and so the discussion around it is around what is theoretically possible, not what is possible today. 

Here’s an example that I think is useful: NFT items could work like HTML files. For a computer system to support HTML files, it only needs a web browser. Different computer systems might only support particular web browser, but any web browser can open any valid HTML file. 

This is a problem of creating standard protocols that are widely adopted. It didn’t use to be the case that we had a standard application format like we have now with web apps. Just imagine a developer in the 80s arguing why there would never be a single language that could be written to run on any device in the world. 

The problems of getting a single program to run on any computer in the world is similar, but different to the problem of “standard items”. For one, items must exist in a universe, and not all game universes are compatible. 

This is why I think NFT items will begin with games that have very similar universes (similar physics, similar animation styles, etc). “This game supports standard Shooter items!”.  Upgrades could be made to the standard itself, but old items would always work with new games (like old websites still work). 

In this way, game items will be understood to be more like software, and games themselves will be understood to be what they actually are: a virtual machine that can run software. Can your game run standard-item.nft?",1643213963.0,1

It’s not a zero sum game. If the game company cannot cheat and consumer demand therefore goes up, the in game items would have more value. In this way, the consumer and the game company can both win.

The problem is how that asset would fit into the other game - making the asset fit into a different game than it was intended for takes dev time to do. It's not a simple drag & drop.

My thought is that the per transaction energy cost for both PoS and Centralized are approaching 0, or at least relatively similar.

Lets assume you want to buy something with a PoS crypto vs. a credit card. You still have the Point of sale system at the store that consumes the same energy. You still have to transmit the information through the internet to the payment processors under both systems. Then you have to process that transaction and record it, which again should basically be the same.

&#x200B;

So what is different? The storage of the actual database. This is where I think the difference lies. For any decentralized payment system, you have to have duplication of the blockchain. Server costs are what is different here. Every miner is hosting a copy of the blockchain. That means that there are going to be hundreds of duplicate servers constantly hosting the blockchain. A centralized data center can probably have fairly good redundancy with 2-3x, and that is further optimized by the fact that you can have 1 database that is used, and the backups can be compressed and encrypted. With the blockchain, all the nodes need to be available at any time, because nodes can go down at anytime.

292,CryptoTechnology,Need help understanding NFT gaming.,lorenzomofo,1643069258.0,33,22,0.79,"These are all great questions.

There are lots of moving parts to how an NFT game might work, and it’s probably beyond the scope of a Reddit comment (for me) to explain all of them.  I would recommend doing some research into Axie Infinity. It’s the biggest NFT game (I think?), and I’m pretty sure there are many websites or comment threads you can search for that will explain how it works. 

That being said, let me see if I can do my best with an analogy. 

An NFT game will have an aspect to it that is like a trading card game (like Pokémon). In fact, I believe this is the reason that Axie is itself is so much like Pokémon. In a trading card game, a player will buy or trade for cards that are then used to play other players that also have created their own decks. Each card represents something: could be a game character (like a Pokémon), could be a game item (like a potion), could be proof of an event (a card you got that shows you beat someone in a game). Some cards look the same as other cards (we can have the same Pokémon), while other cards look completely unique (a card that represents you, or a one-of-a-kind Pokémon). 

What’s important is that while some cards look the same (they are for the same Pokémon), each card is still a separate object. Each object will have it own unique history. It will have a known lineage of owners, for instance, or might have a known history of games it’s been used in. 

Any game with mechanics that can be mapped on to something like this could have those mechanics executed on a blockchain. Eg - a record of changes in ownership of cards, or in events that reference cards. 

The rest of the game could be executed off chain. For instance - the graphics of the cards (like animations of Pokémon) could all execute off chain. Events of the game that cannot be “saved” may sometimes not need to be executed on chain (eg, some interactions with NPCs that are not saved).",1643233752.0,1

In the case of Cartesi, I don't think it's likely to pump for either of two reasons: 1) hype or 2) organic buy-in from devs because it's ""easier"".

What I haven't seen mentioned in this thread is that Cartesi renders things previously impossible with DLT,  practical.  I honestly don't expect Cartesi to capture any mindshare from Matic, Polkadot, Loopring, or any other ETH scaling solution.  Also, I don't expect any signficant number of traditional devs to migrate to the space because Cartesi lowered their barriers of entry.  IMHO, Cartesi appreciates several 'x'  if it enables some usecase practical on a fully emulated deterministic environment that's impractical or impossible on just a VM.  This statement probably comes off as more of a bullish case for Cartesi than I intend (i.e 'of course this unique capability will bring value'), but honestly how much of crypto is actually about this kind of utility?  Crypto trends,  by and large, reward platforms built for speculation (ICO, DeFi, NFT's).  There are extremely few utility oriented projects without an extremely narrow focus that gain much real-world adoption. The Vinn diagram of code that needs to be 1) distributed + determinstic 2) censorship resistant / trustless 3)  too ""heavy"" (or latency sensitive) to run on L1 or another L2 but 4) small enough to run on a minimalistic Linux VM and 5) is not too senstive to distrubute to strangers on the internet (or the dataset is small enough to render homomorphic encryption practical) is pretty small IMO.

After saying all this, I have to disclose I own a fair amount of Cartesi because I am absolutely in love with the tech, but I am under no illusion that this project is set to disrupt anything anytime soon.

I'll copy and paste a reply I wrote over in /r/Hedera regarding Hedera's overall business model (and roadmap, I guess), just cos ain't nobody got time rewriting. Last couple paragraphs are the relevant bit but the rest is context.

""Many enterprises prefer a private dag network at the core of their infrastructure and for areas where they simply do not need public consensus.

These are designed to be modular and interoperable - this is more akin to tradition databases but built on the same kind of technology. 

IBM offer a whole suite of modular services for enterprise use in this area, with Walmart and Land Rover being some of the notable users. 

Hashgraph is designed to interoperate with these networks seamlessly providing public consensus or other specific functions if needed. 

The information is immutably encoded with no single point of failure, this remains very valuable - the private networks are more databases where Hashgraph helps create the internet out of them and allows parties that wish to do so interact directly with each other's databases with absolute trust.

In order to achieve this, Hedera offer the HCS - the simple and seamless capability of using the consensus service and nothing else. This isn't limited to private networks, anyone can use it if they so desire, as long as they pay their fees. 

This is useful for many Hyperledger clients, and you'll notice a significant overlap when comparing them with Hedera ecosystem partners (Walmart are heavily involved in promoting a new universal standard for digital coupons built entirely on Hedera's Hashgraph for example)

They also offer the HTS - programmable tokens at the native layer with all the performance on offer from the Hashgraph Algorithm (these offer about 80% of the functionality of Smart Contracts according to Mance - the rest can obviously be covered by the EVM and competing projects - if needed they can absolutely develop a superior smart contract platform but Hyperledger is already taking a good part towards this so mutual value is found.

The idea of modular, interoperable, open source infrastructure building up web 3.0 is the whole idea. You don't achieve that when one project wins alone, Hedera nonetheless offers value to the other parties within the ecosystem - that's what we're all about right? Cut out inefficiency and utilise the value gained. Just maths.

This brings me to the Hedera Smart Contract Service 

Hedera themselves aim to fully integrate Hyperledger Besu, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in the coming weeks - allowing Ethereum based dApps to run within Hedera and interact seamlessly with the Hedera ecosystem.  

Once complete, all the Ethereum developers have to do is copy and paste their code into the virtual machine and suddenly their dApp is running perfectly yet with the ~300 TPS of Besu. Kind of a no brainer as we wait for Ethereum 2.0 - and once that is in place the EVM will be able to at least keep up with the open source product, and likely continue to outpace it in the long term.",1642685654.0,2

Maybe quantum computing shakes things up, maybe something else does. Layer 2s are less speculative than that but speculative nonetheless

""Enterprise use demands stability in price - you need to write up a budget including operating costs so that you can see whether engaging in that activity is viable for your business. You simply cannot do that with variable gas fees, certainly not those of Ethereum-  and even Polygon's offering has been demonstrated to be a long way off with even a relatively small transaction volume. 

Why would an enterprise adopt and use a product that can suddenly increase 100x in cost without warning? Let alone one that can double.

Furthermore, HBAR fees may be fixed but the council can adjust them as they see fit. 

For example, minting an NFT costs $1. Avery Dennison plan to tokenize trillions of products, DLA Piper started out looking at tokenizing real-estate, now their plans go much further than even that. Obviously the adjustability of fees go both ways, I'm not hinging my argument on this particular revenue stream, the point is there's a lot you've missed, including other transaction types with their own associated fees.

Right now, for cryptocurrency transactions the price is fixed at (I think) 0.0001 USD. This is useful in its own right because it allows micropayment based usecases - a market which is completely inconceivable to you right now.

This is adequate at the moment as it incentives adoption and creates new possibilities. 

Right now the plan is to fund node operators through the treasury in the short term, if the current fees prove to be untenable past that stage, they will be changed. Adequately incentivising node operators to secure the network is an integral part of the design.

If, in the future, it is deemed that this particular type of transaction should cost more (or less) then this can be done. 

If the USD falls out of favour, they can find something else to peg it to.

If the miners turn out to be right and DLT is really just about paying a lot of money to miners and hodlers, then they can ramp the fees right up if they so desire.

My point is that this control Hedera have is a unique strength - you might disagree with how they've utilised it (I trust them and their partners a hell of a lot more than a random redditor), but nonetheless, the competing options are simply inferior and nothing else. 

They cannot be controlled or fixed because the gas demands are driven by fundamental limitations in the architecture of the other networks. Hedera's architecture is better. That's why they are being adopted""

Compromise is decentralization. 'One day the companies on our network will run more of the nodes' isn't even a promise to become decentralised, it's distributing cost/responsibility of operation but not to a meaningful degree as it's hand selected node operators.

That's OK because it doesn't look like HBAR is really trying to compete with L2s. It's competing with enterprise blockchain. The TPS, etc etc etc, should all be way better- there are only 20 nodes. Ethereum ~10k is a fair baseline. Again HBAR isn't trying to compete on decentralization, that's fine, but it does mean as platform there is a compromise. Its not speed, UX or 'security' from external forces you sacrifice, it's the ability to (hypothetically) spin up a node and 'fact check' what the team says/does etc. 

Also the EVM compatible 'just ctrl+c ctrl+v' meme seems to imply 'it just works' but how can it reconcile different EVM implementations? Sure I buy ethereumJS to HBAR is copy+paste but what if the code isn't JS to begin with? I'm not technical enough to know so I'm asking authentically.

Well that's the thing, with Hedera's governance currently decentralized between a council of 25 legally accountable, term limited, real world institutions - each running a secure and high quality node with independent infrastructure - Hedera offers new qualities of transparency and regulation, and does not hinge on the dubious security of anonymous governance or overreaching developer control. 

In this current state I would go as far to say that it's more decentralized than any networks disproportionately using only a few centralized servers in a few geographically centralized location. The amount of nodes is also less relevant than the amount of nodes operators. 

What you missed is that this design is a deliberate approach to create the conditions needed for a permissionless, fully distributed network down the line - and yes, create a product secure enough for enterprise use (which fully aligns with the demands of secure public use in this case) 

Going permissionless straight off the bat without creating safeguards against exploitation means that while your network can be decentralized in theory, it is far less likely to be in reality. The truth is that the extremely wealthy disproportionately control these systems right now and there is no way to reliably reverse that. 

And there will be millions of nodes, run by us, on our phones. Hedera possessing genuine scalability means they are able to achieve incredible performance and security. When I say there's no compromise I really mean there just isn't one. It's pure mathematical efficiency at every level. 

They are competing with the Layer 2 of other networks by achieving what they do at the native layer - Hedera's own Layer 2s will be built as appropriate and will represent absolute technological advance - not petty competition. For example, ZK snarks are one of the more well designed Hedera Improvement Proposal made thus far and I would expect it to be on the way - reconciling private trust with public transparency.

Effective and transparent governance - not something Eth possesses I'm sorry to say - is an essential part of the equation - even a fourth prong to the 'Trilemma' if you ask me.

When your system is dependant on goodwill it is absolutely and irreconciably vulnerable to exploitation, take communism - another ideology which people love in theory but fell tragically short in practice because too much trust was given in those who controlled the means based on their 'commitment' to the 'greater good'.

Hedera offer universal zero trust architecture for the world - much larger in scope, requirements, and stakes than anything we've seen.

I'm honestly lacking in terms of the technical knowledge so I'm afraid I can't help to much with your developer based questions - don't really know what the process looks like 

I will say Hedera and the HBAR foundation offer a lot of technical support - both published and on-demand. The blog at Hedera.com might be a good place to start.

So my understanding is that the EVM used in Smart Contracts 1.0 currently supports most Ethereum based code running with the efficiency, low latency, and predictable fees of Hedera (note the predictable fees are rooted in the fact that you couldn't congest it if you tried, and would make me a lot of money trying). 

The tokens remain outside of the Hedera network however and smart contracts only run with a TPS equal to that of Ethereum- itself 

The Hyperledger Besu integration behind Smart Contracts 2.0 however is much more capable, fully compatible with solidity, with throughput in the hundreds of TPS. 

Vitally, these smart contracts are now fully interoperable with Hedera's native layer - tokens can be wrapped and moved around with the full attributes of Hedera's native layer including security, finality, speed. 

Their own smart contracts will be able to operate with Besu's performance - a drastic improvement on Ethereum at present which can be continually developed to at least match any advances Eth rolls out.

Ethereum is like a general purpose decentralised computer where you have a lot of freedom with what you can build on top of it and pay for computation time whether it succeeds or not. Tokens and non-fungible tokens are simply a code standard.

Algorand utilize the account model like Ether. The account model works by removing tokens from one account and adding it to another account in a transaction causing the state of all involved accounts to be a part of the transaction. Instead of being general purpose, it is developed for financial assets and has native support for it. This simplifies some things like asset transfers, has some benefits like fixed cost, and comes with a lot of features and configurability for assets making it suitable for regulated assets.

Cardano use an UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output) model, similar to Bitcoin, instead of an account model. To send a transaction you spend tokens as inputs and create new UTxOs. One address can have several UTxOs so instead of a global state of accounts you have to validate for a transaction, you simply spend a token as an input and create a UTxO belonging to a different address. Cardano doesn't offer feature rich assets like Algorand or decentralised computing like Ethereum but you can accomplish some of the same things by making a Script/UTxO that holds an NFT or Token instead of an account holding it directly.

As an analogy: there are some operations that your computer can do right in its hardware, and so it is not necessary to write a program to execute them. For instance, arithmetic like integer addition is an operation that modern cpus have a module for (the ALU). It is, however, still possible to do addition without making use of this hardware (although this would be a nutty idea).

>The set of shards can be arbitrarily sized, enabling massive parallelization of the consensus process. Notably, this form of parallelization introduces a tunable tradeoff between security and scalability: reducing the number of shards each node covers increases parallelism and scale, but decreases the validator set size of a given shard. This capability allows the system designer to select a minimum threshold of per-shard node coverage that achieves high practical security, while maximizing parallelism and scale by allowing a large number of independent nodes. This is unique to Cerberus and discussed further in the analysis section.

So they can *kinda* place the tradeoff however they want with the way their sharding design works.  But the way they frame it here is the misleading part, and where it reveals that Radix doesn't really solve any new problems because they don't do anything to decrease the overall load of fully verifying the ledger, so sacrificing decentralization as the network utilization increases and compromising its resistance to validator corruption by forcing reliance on third parties.",1642614801.0,1

These are incorrect - processing is also extremely parallel and only happens on the shards related to a transaction.

The Cerberus Infographic series is a great resource that digs into the mechanisms behind Cerberus cross shard consensus and the role the Radix Engine plays to abstract away dealing w/ sharded data from dApps and the developer.

[https://www.radixdlt.com/post/cerberus-infographic-series-chapter-vi](https://www.radixdlt.com/post/cerberus-infographic-series-chapter-vi)

>***Chapter 12 selections - on parallel transactions across shards***  
>  
>Moreover, one of the key concepts that allows this to happen is that of parallel processing. In a future where Radix has scaled to fulfill the DeFi needs of billions of people, the vast majority of transactions will involve completely unrelated substates, shards, and validator sets. Those transactions will be processed entirely in parallel across the vastness of the shardspace without ever being “aware” that the other transactions exist.  
>  
>But not everything can be processed in parallel. There must still be some logic that tells Cerberus when substates are related and must be composed in the same transaction.  
>  
>***Chapter 13 selections - on partial ordering***  
>  
>Therefore ideally, you have a network that’s intelligent enough to only order when it’s absolutely necessary, so that it can process as many transactions as possible in parallel. We therefore want a network that has “partial ordering”  
>  
>....  
>  
>For Radix, that layer of logic is the Radix Engine. It tells Cerberus which substates are related and must be ordered, and which ones are not related and do not need to be ordered and can thus be safely parallelized.  
>  
>So how does the Radix Engine do this?  
>  
>When a transaction is created, it must follow rules stipulated by the Radix Engine. Those rules stipulate that only required substates are used in a transaction, and that when new substates are created, that those are broken down into as many substates as possible, that still make logical sense  
>  
>....  
>  
>Because of the Radix Engine, nodes therefore only need to undertake consensus on the absolutely most minimal set of shards required.

is people spending large quantities of money* for tokens which represent an image and do little else, a trend which will die out shortly? Hopefully.   

I don't see what problem you think NFTs for music is supposed to solve? You talk about removing middlemen, but NFTs don't seem to provide anything for that that just, letting people buy the song online using a cryptocurrency, doesn't already provide.  

If you think that they could help with DRM for audio in a way that isn't feasible for DRM for images on account of images being screenshot-able, you should know that the same can be done with audio (might be slightly more difficult, but cannot be really protected against.).  

(Also, DRM on music is against freedom)  

I of course agree that being able to more easily create/handle tokens that represent individual intangible things can be useful.

edit: also, if scalability issues are solved (or possibly using a permissioned chain with a large number of known entities, who could be held accountable for any behavior contrary to what the protocol dictates?) then the idea (which some are already pursuing) of using tokens to track what resources went into making products, in order to be assured about where the materials came from, and where the labor and other steps were done, when a manufacturing process involves materials being bought and sold between many companies. Like e.g. where did the oil come from to make this plastic? where was the plastic made? where was the plastic made into parts of shoes? The shoe company presumably doesn't process the oil into plastic themselves, nor the other materials.
Of course, these assurances would only be as trustworthy as those who made them, at least this would make it so they can be tracked. Like, if you are making a cake to sell, you can't generate yourself the assurance that the eggs were from a farm with humanely raised chickens without inventing a made-up farm entity to sign those, which people wouldn't recognize as an existing farm. An actual farm might claim to raise their chickens humanely but not actually do so, and this wouldn't solve that problem, but there are other solutions for that part. This still helps avoid the issue of the cake-maker making up the info about the source of the eggs though. (Because, the problem of checking if a farm exists is even more solved than checking if the farm raises their chickens humanely.)  

(to be clear, I'm not like, especially interested myself in animal welfare stuff, just describing it as a use.
Another use could be getting certifications that various steps in the process didn't emit large amounts of CO2, or something. Would need certification organizations for that, but still.)",1642553882.0,6

To mint an NFT opensea charges 2.5% of final price , same with rarity and in case of nifty is 5% and 50cents on every secondary sale, This may sound a lot but the thing is that all this gas fee should be there to incentivize the miners, without which all this would never happen.

 Also more users might/might not decrease the gas fee as this would lead to congestion and hence higher the gas fee faster will your nft be minted.

The main way that I have thought about NFTs being useful would be in a subscription/membership based model. Like for example if an exclusive restaurant issued X amount of NFTs that indicated that you held a reoccurring reservation, or just that you were allowed to eat at that particular restaurant. This NFT now not only holds value for the owner of it, but also for the restaurant.

The restaurant would gain an initial investment, and the customer now has an asset that will hopefully appreciate if the restaurant does well. Now if it does appreciate, then the customer could sell the NFT for a profit, the restaurant could then make X percentage on the resale, and would now have record of who the person sold to. This would obviously be a permission based blockchain.

I think that NFTs in particular could be useful for something like this because if it’s a smaller, permission blockchain then it would be easier to track sale and re-sale history. It would also just streamline some processes (re-sale, commission collection, knowing who holds what NFT) that could otherwise be a nuisance, or simply not cost efficient. They could also have an NFT verification system at the restaurant to prevent any forgery. There are definitely other ways to do this outside of just NFTs but this has been the primary way that I see NFTs actually having utility.

This is exactly why L2's exist, to take transactions and ""knowledge"" off L1 where it's expensive to have and into L2 where it's much cheaper. 

*"" Are there any safeguards to ensure that L2 doesn't act maliciously?""*

There are two levels of safeguards. The first is in L2 itself, depending on the L2 technology itself and how it's configured, there are generally rules about what you can and can't do and you will be punished if you do not follow them. This ""punishment"" step is often handled by the L1, and this is the second layer of safeguard. For example, if you are transferring coins through some lightning nodes and one lightning node doesn't transfer the coins as promise, a lightning node can take that info to the L1 chain and say ""hey, look, they promised they'd transfer the coins and they didn't!"" and L1 chain will force the transfer or revert the transfer or whatever the rules require. In short, L2 provides transaction capacity while relying on L1 only for enforcing rules when something goes wrong.

For optimistic rollups, the safeguard is that participants who verify the transactions and submit fraud proofs in case of any fraudulent activity.

For ZK rollups, the layer 1 smart contract verifies that the zero knowledge proofs submitted by the layer 2 operators are valid.

\>  What if an L2 operator pushes an update that sends 10% of every transaction to their own wallet

Transactions have to be signed by the sender, otherwise they are invalid. For zk rollups, this means that an operator trying to insert fraudulent transactions will submit an invalid zero knowledge proof that will be rejected by the layer 1 smart contract. For optimistic rollups, this means that a participant who detects the fraud can submit a fraud proof and be rewarded for it while the malicious operator is penalized.

I suppose it's not too dissimilar from how you already have to trust smart contracts, however the big difference I think is that computation is now offchain and can not be trusted to stay the same (actually a bit similar to how you actually have to trust ANY Dapp web frontend to talk to the correct smart contract on chain)",1642410791.0,7

The only way an operator would know a signature that satisfies that constraint is if the account owner *really did* sign that transaction, so it works out.

But this has nothing to do whether it's an L1 or L2. If a user signs a transaction that's what's going to happen. If the transaction includes a 20% *fee* to whoever, that's the users fault for not checking what they're signing.  

Most L2s use the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) as well, so the same rules as on L1 apply.  

The computation can be trusted because the proofs are submitted on-chain.

726,CryptoCurrency,El Salvador angrily rejects IMF call to drop Bitcoin use,allthew4yup,1643667701.0,308,1410,0.96,"I've pondered this.  Bitcoin's (and all crypto's) perceived value is pegged to dollars, euros, yuan, etc.  But what happens when a few more countries adopt bitcoin and abandon their national currency.  We are seeing weaker economic players adopt it officially.  Or their people just switch naturally because crypto is already better then a hyper inflating national fiat that's being ruined by their government. 

So we have El Salvador.  Nigeria, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and maybe a dozen other weaker economies go all in.  Then maybe a few European countries abandon the Euro or at least support bitcoin or some form of crypto.  Imagine economic depression in China, or Russia or the US that caused people to lose faith in their country's fiat.  Maybe it's not 100% but a large portion of the population realize their country is vulnerable to greed, corruption, bailouts, manipulation (of the stock market maybe?), etc. 

At a certain point, there hits a tipping point where a cascade of countries or people jump in out of fear of being left out.  Imagine musical chairs, but the countries/people to sit last, have the worst financial position.  So if there are 300 chairs, 100 countries jump in, the others are trying to hold on to their legacy monetary systems like a game of chicken.

Pretend the US jumped in tomorrow, all in.  Would that dissolve almost all other national currencies?  The reserve of the world becomes bitcoin eventually, with or without the dollar on board.

Each national economy that collapses falls into bitcoin as a tamper proof fall back.  Would you rather have bitcoin or the Zimbabwe dollar?  Zimbabwe has already tried to reset their hyper inflation 3 times in 40 years by just making a new one.  They just can't handle a national currency, and I have to believe the people have 0 fucking faith left in their country's currency.

Each time that happens, another country just reverts to crypto.  Maybe 100 years from now its just US, China, Russia, and EU currency along with crypto.  China is on the verge of real estate collapse, and is also in a trade war with the US.  Russia is antagonizing WW3.  And the US bailed out bankers in 2008 (the reason bitcoin was created), keep pumping money into the system, trying to reel in the inflation rate, also in a trade war and world policing Russia.

Events could occur much sooner then 100 years (maybe 1-2 years) that could seriously destabilize any of those currencies.  If the dollar inflates, it only fuels bitcoin's pump.  It's a faith based system, perceived value.  The higher bitcoin goes, the weaker all those other currencies become.  Somewhat of a self fulfilling prophecy.

There is still a local sandwich shop in my town that refuses to accept credit card.  They are old fashion as fuck.  But 99% of the world accepts some form of credit card.  There food is fuckin bangin, best cheesesteak and breakfast sandwich around.  But I don’t go there as often as I would since I don’t always have cash.  It’s a pain in the ass.  They are annoying as fuck, I’d prefer a 10% upcharge, fuck I’d pay 30% premium their food is so good.  But they want fucking cash and that’s obnoxious. 

An entire industry came in, demanded 3% on transactions, and a combination of vendors eating the cost or customers taking a price raise gave them their credit card cut.

Old timers say “cash is king.”  But us younger finance kids think “cash is trash.”  Total stock average is at 13% for the last 12 years.  Your cash lost out on 13% rise in value.  We are already experiencing the demise of cash.  More trendy stores, millennial shop types, literally don’t accept cash.  It’s all square pay, they don’t want wage slaves handling cash.  Plus I earn unlimited 2% paying with credit card.  Everything goes on credit card except my mortgage (and even that becomes worth it with fees if your house is over like $2 million but who owns a $2 million home and worries about 2% back on spending?)

Cash is dead.  Argue that it is not and we can at least agree it’s been shot in the head and still twitching.

If someone wants to pay you in Bitcoin, you can just accept and convert to your preferred currency.  It’s the usage and adoption that will force the hand of global economics.

It’s only gaining momentum in the adoption phase.  Some country is going to be that pain in the ass sandwich shop that only accepts dollars (their fiat over crypto).  And they’re going to be the most stubborn and the most disadvantaged when it gets to that point.

Idk your job or company, but eventually you look up realize more customers and vendors are accepting crypto then fiat.  More employees elect to be paid in crypto over fiat.  Just like credit cards, it’s been rolled out and the number of users only grows.

Nobody is abandoning current systems to go backwards.  I can only see more and more people utilizing crypto then reverting back to gold/silver coins.

This is probably one of the largest benefits of crypto, it is still in it's infancy, but valid projects are starting up.


There are billions of people that don't have access to the international banking system. Many places simply don't have the infrastructure such as electricity to have a bank. On the other hand, cell phones are prevalent and crypto works a charm on them. Even in the US there are between 30-50+ million people that are unbanked, which is why there is a check cashing/loan shark industry. 



DeFi gives people the opportunity to put money somewhere they have control over it, it is harder to be stolen by institutions, and can even make more money by investing it into staking reward pools and other financial opportunities.



Middle class people can also benefit by investing into new coins and projects where as to get in on the ground floor of a stock offering you have to be ""accredited"" meaning you have to be able to prove that you have over a million dollars in liquid assets to legally invest in those hot takes. 


There are other projects worthy if attention. [Althea](https://althea.net) is a internet ISP that separates the backhaul internet, service/maintenance, and infrastructure layers so that multiple entities own different parts of the system. Each part gets paid algorithmically and automatically, there is no billing, no one has to make a phone call demanding money. 


NFTs are used as expensive pictures, which I think is dumb, but Non-Fungible Tokens have huge potential. How about a drivers license that is a NFT. You could provide proof that you have a valid license without giving your name or any other information by verification of your private key.

I would say that the vaporware is real in the domain, I got into crypto because I wanted to develop a CO2 ledger (with some specific features). I got disillusioned because none of the available technologies was able to sustain my idea, and scale in a sustainable manner (and fast enough manner). So I ended up making my own (mind you I am in no way smart enough to develop the novel consensus, the founding team had three PhDs for a reason).

A point I would like to make, is that the community is a driving factor in the way a lot of the unhealthy projects develop. 

Tokennomics, when moon, when exchange, when marketing, etc.

Like: now that I’ve gotten mine we need to change the token model so the tokens get even rarer. And let’s use all the money on ads. These are things people actually demand.

A lot of the loudest community members are the ones demanding unhealthy growth in value, and those projects that end up listening to those people to silence the critiques, end up making choices that doesn’t benefit the project, but instead the early investors.

So few people are truly in it for the tech. Most people are chasing the unicorn growth projects.

Proper use cases will come, I’m glad to state that my old project (which will have to remain unnamed for the integrity of this post*) are still taking the high road, and they have a good focus and are actually doing really well.

The general utility of the tech is out there, the projects that focus on it just doesn’t get “pumped” as much, so it will take a while for them to catch up.

Also some projects are simply applying blockchain to things that don’t need it. Just because we’ve invented a hammer, we don’t need to hit everything with it.

A currency that is deflationary and not controlled by the banks seems like a good idea, but it didn't go at all as planned.  We are just replacing banks with new banks.  Crypto exchange and transfer fees are even worse than with fiat, it still takes too long when it matters, the wealthy still control most of the supply, the markets are still heavily manipulated, and transactions are tax events.  All that stuff about ""but nobody can take it from you"" is nonsense.  People lose their coins to scams, viruses, and bad hard drives with no recourse. If you lose or encounter fraud with your Visa card, you don't lose anything.  ""But deflation is eating away at your fiat savings"". Yeah, but fiat savings with inflation is better during bear markets than taking a 50% to 75% dip on a deflationary asset.

Really all we have accomplished with crypto is to realize that our stock market valuations no longer have very much to do with the companies behind them and we are all just gambling, so why waste our time trying to build a 50 million dollar company that trades at 50 Billion when we can just trade unique strings and jpegs at similar market caps? 

Copy/Paste/Rename/Pre-mine and you have a new shit-coin market.  Make it inflationary with a supply in the quadrillions and you get a very low unit price, which attracts a shitload of people that don't understand what a market cap is. You might think those idiots are the minority, but just look at the crap that makes it into the top of the market cap charts. Clones of clones of jokes.

To legitimize the space for serious projects, government has to step in to protect people from the scams, but most governments, especially the USA, would sooner see it all die off because they want to hold a tight grip on the monopolistic power to issue currency. They drop literal bombs to protect the role that their currency plays in the world.

It was fun in the early days to nerd out in IRC, fill rooms up with GPUs, run mining pools, and feel like we are sticking it to the old guard, but now I just trade the 4-year cycles with lots of patience.

The problem with crypto currently is that everyone on this board only uses it as an (speculative) investment asset. Rarely do I see a holder use it as a currency - because they'll be afraid of losing the gains. It needs to be stable to be used as a currency. On the flip side, if it was stable - no one on this board would invest in it.

The thing is, you just **can't** regulate **most** cryptocurrencies.

Yeah, if you needed to resort to VPNs/deep web/anonymously browse the internet to access your crypto holdings, resort to mixers and privacy coins to break tx's and be considered a tax evader/criminal for doing so, most of retail would be scared away, but that just hinders it's especulative asset classification, not the actual trustless p2p network use case it was actually intended for (Although yes, at that point it would be a criminal haven since all people on it are technically outlaws).

Quantum Computing Resistance would be the only real hindrance to Monero here, because it can compromise the network's security, and that too would only come in handy when quantum computers become prevalent, as of today it would take a multi billion dolar corporation like google to turn into a malicious actor in order for quantum resistance to cbe useful.

Is currency a scam or Ponzi scheme? Currency has no intrinsic value beyond what we agree it’s valued at. The only reason that note in your wallet has value is because we collectively agree it does. 

There are also *some* benefits to some crypto such as zero fee instant transfers for people in developing nations, and you’re forgotten that adoption helps secure the chain, and the money part is incentive for adoption.

A scam insinuates you’re being purposely mislead by someone, given the decentralised nature of the major coins like BTC and such it can’t really be a scam. It’s a speculate high risk asset sure, but that doesn’t make it a scam.

Depending on the example that blockchain can be either a public blockchain or private blockchain. If you want it truly auditable such as for the IRS example, then a public blockchain.

And if you think all that is possible without, then we should already have it. Our current IT infrastructures are a horrible and disgusting mess of poorly implemented security practices, such as clear-text password files for users stored on a web server that the Admin forgot to encrypt, or security scans that only have their high priority issues resolved (if that!) and all other issues ignored. 

To say we can do all this now without blockchain tech completely ignores the amazing amount of security that a matured and audited blockchain backend can provide at its base layer. Literally anything built on top gets that security. In a world of massive data beaches, where things such as PRINTER MACHINES can execute malicious code on your servers, how can you possibly say it can all be done without the benefits that blockchain brings?

Will we EVER know exactly how many USD are in circulation? Will we EVER know where our tax money truly goes without a public blockchain backed ledger system? 

You want transparency? That is literally possible with a properly developed blockchain that can finally enable the features we’ve only been able to dream of but not implement.

Here's a fun fact about contracts: they mean absolutely nothing until a judge is reading them. They mean **nothing.** They are written at the start of a professional relationship as guiding terms, and hopefully, no one ever needs to go back and read it, because by the time you do- something has gone wrong.

The entire idea of automating contracts misunderstands the nature of contracts. Contracts are guidelines for human relationships, and do not, on their own, solve human problems.

Those are *legal* contracts. I'm referring to any contract that guarantees a particular output given a set of defined inputs e.g *smart contracts*. When the output is guaranteed, no mediation is necessary.

Here's an example scenario...

1. Input: I purchase a ticket to a conference on Ticketmaster with my debit card. To do so, I have to provide them with PII/my card details which opens me up to all sorts of possible issues but let's ignore that.
2. The transaction is sent through multiple third-parties until it eventually gets to my bank to see if I have the funds and if they are ok with me spending the funds. Assuming we made it this far...
3. Output: Ticketmaster issues a ticket which is really just a row in a database they have 100% control over and I have practically no visibility into.
4. An archaic transfer process ensues and assuming nothing breaks eventually the money gets to Ticketmaster.
5. I arrive at the conference and present an email receipt or a ticket ID on their shitty app dashboard that I'm only ever going to use once.

Now let's compare that to:

1. Input: I purchase a ticket to a conference on a Ticketmaster dapp with any token they support. I can do so completely anonymously.
2. Output: the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain and I'm immediately issued an NFT that is now visible in the same wallet I use for everything else. I have full visibility into this entire transaction and can confirm the exact outcome beforehand if I wish by looking at the contract source code.
3. I arrive at the conference and present the NFT or maybe sign a transaction to confirm I do indeed own the NFT. Again, in the same wallet I use for everything else.

Not for a company to run their internal databases.

This isn't trading or investing, it's just gambling on internet points. Doge is no more and no less of a gamble compared to every other coin. Yeah, bitcoin is king, but it still goes up and down on a random walk. The rest tend to follow the trend at various multiples. The only difference between the casino and crypto is that at the casino there is always a house edge. Roulette is the fairest game, and even roulette pays out 1:36 on 1:38 odds. In crypto, the house edge is the comission you pay, be it a ""coinbase fee,"" a percentage a la kraken, or with a wide ass spread a la the ""commission free"" brokers. The exchanges just take a little cut on the initiation of a bet. Theoretically, all of these are random walks with an expected value change of 0 - you are just as likely to see a 1% gain as a 1% loss, with the expectation of 0 gain. But then, you lost a tiny bit entering the trade, so when you exit at the same price you get whacked again.

I am often in trades that last from only 1 minute, to trades that could go on for weeks, depending on the trends of the markets in Forex. But, once a certain point of loss happens, I'm out of the trade (Stop Loss). One can do this with crypto. Both with a longer trade with Bitcoin, or with a shorter trade with a new coin just listed on CoinGecko. 

As long as you buy something at a certain value, and sell it at a certain value, it's a trade. Gain or loss.

But, if you're just Yolo'ing with no plan of when to get out of a good or bad situation, and not doing your own research (fundamental, technical, and sentimental analysis) you're gambling.

Initially I was trying to be more investor and thought I'll just check in once a month to make sure the company didn't go bust! lol Then the drop drop drop happened and I end up selling a bit to damage control.

That's when I realise that if I sell and buy back lower, I actually get more eth/btc. That got me a bit into trading mode, 'cos with all the current volatility, I can get like $500 \~ $700 on a good day, which I can choose to put into my 20% pool or dollar average down my 80%.

Using that phrase speaks volumes about you, op. Let’s unpack it.

If true then you’re naive to not understand the context, GoFundMe’s popularity and the inherent difficulty in deploying crowdfunded distributed money raising campaigns. After the fiasco around the crowdsourced bid on the copy of the Declaration of Independence (which basically wiped out contributions with the gas fees / cost of getting refunds), any crowdsourcing campaign is right to be wary of crypto. It’s clearly not ready.

If it’s not true then you’re a disingenuous shill. If think you’re smart enough to understand crypto then understanding a traditional fundraising campaign should be very easy. There’s going to be a reason and an ulterior motive - sitting on bags of something that you’re reflexively shilling, perhaps.",1643682192.0,2

It started with not being able to cross the border unvaccinated. Unfortunately for these people, both sides require vaccination. So even IF they managed to get Canada to back down, the USA will still say suck it and send them home. 

It’s turned in to a sideshow with nazi flags, confederate flags, Trump flags (remember, this is Canada), urination on war monuments, shitting on peoples property, assaulting hotel staff, harassing a homeless shelter/soup kitchen.  

All our finest are there.     /s if needed

The other kicker Is they’re protesting at our federal buildings, but a lot of their mandates (vaccine passport, masks, etc) are mandated provincially.  So they’re in the wrong location all together. Also, they’re looking for our Prime Minister, who doesn’t actually live near where they are.  They wanted to know if he was “home”, when knocking the door at his office.  This was a self proclaimed white supremacist and organizer of the convoy.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that several of the organizers are straight up white supremacists.  

Google it if you need more info, there’s so much craziness.  These people like to say Canada isn’t what it used to be. They’re 100% correct because people like this have no place.  

The funds were seized because there was no clear plan or destination for the money.  They raised $7M for ~200 big rigs, ~600 pickups and a bunch of rednecks.  Where is it going to go?  In to the organizers pockets, which isn’t what go fund me is for, nor what they want to be associated with.

1: Allows individuals to accept and cash out donations on a public forum. 

2: Gives prospective doners a secure platform to donate through. 

So what that means is go fund me is really not that different than a Facebook page with a donate directly button. 

If crypto were widely used and accepted, you could just use Facebook and post an eth wallet address and have people send it directly to you. No one can do anything with your wallet address but track the ins and outs and send stuff to it. 

But the payment handling itself isn’t why people use gofundme. Gofundme, unlike crypto, requires KYC. When you donate to a gofundme, you can trust that the organization has at the very least made sure the fundraiser is a real person and can be held accountable. 

It’s like would you rather donate to Patreon/gofundme? Or do you trust the people in the telegram chats who DM you to send $100 to this address and you’ll get back $200 because “trust me bro”",1643665143.0,2

Something that kinda bothers me about the exchange is the insane amount of money they have had for marketing. It's an easy and convenient way to get into crypto and good design in the app. It's great how much exposure they are giving crypto but it's crazy they have that kinda money to spend from fees and making money off of the spread. The amount of money they must have made from the cro pump alone is insane. That being said. It should at least sustain but I worry the people staking just to get sign up bonuses could sell when the time is up.

Positive: great marketing and trust between my bank and their platform. Easy to buy and sell.

Negative: FEES. The amount of fees they charge per withdrawal between wallets and exchanges are insane, $25. 

Crypto.com recently got hacked and will likely not be the last time. Your assets are not secure so always keep them tokens on a ledger wallet. 

Adding new withdrawal addresses on crypto.com to wallets or exchanges are now locked for 24h. Freedom of movement is limited.

Filling up your crypto.com credit card is a one way road. You can buy Euro but you can't sell Euro to different tokens if you regret your decision. Also limited buy power each day, might as well use my regular card...

Defi, crypto loans are great. The good thing is you get more money with the assets you have locked than using Celsius or any similar loaning app/site. The bad side is the rates are high, 12% APR each day. 


I personally have a love & hate relationship with crypto.com. It is simple and easy to use, most of the tokens are listed and you can withdraw to your bank.

However…

The size sometimes doesn’t bring the best economies of scale and smaller but serious projects like blockfi or even more yield.app can beat them hard in terms or APY returns. Not even talking about crazy defi yield farming strategies.

If you are looking for gains, don't think about how much a coin costs but look at market cap and the value of the coin.  CRO can absolutely keep growning because of the use of Crypto dot com.  It is currently ranked at #17 with a market cap of over 10 billion.  If it were to get into the top 10 by doubling it's current market cap, it would double in price.  It would take 10 billion essentially 10 billion of investment to get to that point.  JUNO, a coin I'm bullish on (it's a smart contract platform for the Cosmos ecosystem), has a current price of 16.59 with a market cap of about 650 million.  If JUNO were to move to 17 with a market cap of 10 billion it would be worth about $255 a coin.  It has a much higher potential for growth, and any amount you would invest would see that growth.

They don't move because of reasons. At least not in the abstract sense like, ""CRO is undervalued"" causing it to move upward. Crypto prices move because of rumors and news, it's true. People with good timing will get in at the bottom and get out at the top, once in a while it happens (it's true.)

People get rekt trading cryptos because they fail to set a strategy and honor it. My strategy is ""buy low, sell high"" – but do you think I did that? No. I got rekt instead. RIP me. (You can thank me for this recovery, because I sold all my ETH at the bottom last week.)

Point being, my sale last week is not *the reason* for the recovery this week. There is no *reason* except for simple cause and effect of the variety that is completely unhelpful to this conversation; someone with a strategy and goals has placed their limit orders, and someone else has or hasn't matched them with a market order.

So if your strategy is to look for coins with no reason to fail, and bet big on them until the inevitable turnaround, get ready to wait. It could be 5 months, or it could be 34 months, or you could be waiting for Godot. It could fail to recover for any reason, or no reason at all.",1643671044.0,1

So if a coin is trading at $30 and there are 2,000,000 coins the market cap is $60,000,000.

Each coin has their own market cap or total market value. Bitcoin currently has a market cap of over 724 Billion.

Cro has a market cap of just over 10billion ($0.43 x 25 billion coins)

As far as it increasing it’s market cap Cro does have potential as you can tell it’s just over 1 percent of Bitcoin’s market cap. You then have to decide for yourself how many times you think the price can multiply over the years, but remember every time the price goes up the market cap goes up with it. So if CRO goes to $1 the market cap would be 25 billion. At $4 it would be 100 billion. 

Finally you have to take into account is if the coin will have a continuous supply of coins that will be minted over the years or if there is a set number of coins forever. I’m not sure if CRO has this but if it does that means the supply of CRO will continuously increase for example from 25 billion to 28 billion and so on. Bitcoin for example has an absolute total supply of somewhere around 21 million I think. There will NEVER be more bitcoin than this.

But I'd like a simplier interface, that's 'for stupid people'.. there are so many choices, it's hard to click the right click... (feels like MySpace vs Square or other modern, simplistic design).

Also their flex rates are a bit low and should be reconsidered.

The worst thing that happens is the marketing gets people to click the website / app, people get on the app get confused - then never open it again until a year later.

You really want to keep things as simple as possible when forming the relationship. Like 'get started' should only be Earn and Metal Cards - not merchant services, NFT (too advanced, niche), nor trading (dull).

In part that was due to the LeBron James Foundation news, but it seems that one key thing CRO offers are the lockup periods. They seem to keep the price from flash crashing (so far).

Any CRO staked for a Crypto.com VISA card is locked for 180 days and any CRO staked on The Exchange is also locked for 180 days. But a huge amount of CRO is also locked in varying Earn stakes on the app, from Flexible to 3-month. Yet another huge amount is also locked in the Crypto.com DeFi Wallet. The APY seems to be fairly high (circa 13%), but there is a 30-day debonding period, which helps to ensure that there is never a Bitcoin-style cascade of CRO liquidations.

But since there is already 500 trillion circulating that means the people who hold Shib Inu will have to burn their own stash, but then you have to ask why would someone burn their stash if the value is going to go up? I guess the whales who hold trillions of coins can figure out some way to burn a specific amount of coins to maximize the amount of money they would be able to get, but the problem is everything is decentralized so it would be very hard to coordinate this and ensure everyone is burning what they’re supposed to.

We think of the federal government as the big bad watchdog of everything.

Similarly, the president doesn't have much ""real"" power either; it's just his ability to mobilize Congress and move the troops around (which is admittedly pretty ""real"", but nonetheless limited).

There are going to be some uber-conservative states who make crypto a platform issue for popularity with younger folk, just like there's gonna be some uber-liberal states who make weed a platform issue for popularity with younger folk.

3130,CryptoCurrency,Trying to explain crypto to a friend made me realize something,Protolomeo,1643658112.0,155,426,0.9,"This is how I explain bitcoin to normies:

When you log into your bank account and see how much money you have, that number isn’t actually cash in a vault. It’s just a number on a ledger stored in one of the banks servers.

Bitcoin is exactly the same, except instead of it being stored one private company’s server, it’s processed and stored globally by literally anyone who wants validate it. Since there are tens of thousands of people and companies running the network, it’s unstoppable by any government since they would have to shut down every node in every country.

“Well what if it gets hacked?”

Hacking bitcoin is the same thing as mining it. If you develop a supercomputer that can crack the algorithm fast you’ll get rewarded by the network for doing so. That’s how you become a validator, by using a computer to brute force hack Bitcoin’s encryption.

“Ok so what’s ethereum?”

Ethereum is exactly like bitcoin except for one difference. Bitcoin only tells you how much bitcoin you have. Ethereum does everything else. It’s programmable, and those programs get stored on the global ledger instead of just how much ethereum people have. Because of this it becomes more like a globally validated computer that can do pretty much anything.

“So what about all these other cryptos?”

What ethereum does is extremely ambitious and hard to do. It sacrifices speed and affordability to match Bitcoin’s security. Other cryptos attempt to compete with ethereum by making other sacrifices instead.

3184,CryptoCurrency,Trying to explain crypto to a friend made me realize something,Protolomeo,1643658112.0,155,426,0.9,"So, imagine an excel spreadsheet with 21 million squares/cells. These can be divided too, but let's not worry about that right now. This excel spreadsheet is on a bunch of computers all around the world. Some of the language around cryptocurrency is meant to make it seem like you actually are holding something but you aren't, so I am going to tweak the language a bit. 

The first word that is thrown around a lot is ”wallet.” There is no wallet that is holding something. The wallet is basically just a username and password. The username is the public address and the password is the ""private key"" that only you have. 

On each cell in the Excel spreadsheet it is written the username of the person that “owns” it. What it means to own it, is that you have the password to the username. The only thing this allows you to do is change the username in the cell to someone else if you wanted, this is ""sending"" bitcoin, this is an irreversible process.

So, all these computers are hooked up together, and they all have to agree on who owns each cell, this is determined by consensus, whatever over 50 percent of the computing power of all the computers say, that is what goes. 

To make sure someone doesn't just come along with some super computer and take over the excel spreadsheet, rewards are given out. If you have a powerful computer, you can keep track of this spreadsheet, and you prove how powerful your computer is by making your computer solve math problems that it is hard for them to solve, than you get to write your username in some of the cells that are still blank. 

Since the people who own these powerful computers are making bitcoin (mining) and able to sell them for real money based on the value at the time, this makes it so there is enough powerful computers keeping track of the spreadsheet, that it would cost too much money to build a computer to take over the spreadsheet. 

Some cryptocurrencies like Ethereum allow you to put more than just a username in a block, they also let you put a few lines of code in the block, this is what they call a “smart contract”, what it really is just a really simple computer program. You can put a smart contract in a cell to make one of these cells a super special cell, there is a unique code in the cell so that even if you change the username of who owns it, there is still the special code that makes it special, there is no other special cell like this special cell, because you typed some special stuff into it. 

This is an NFT, a non fungible token. It just means if you give it to someone else, the person you give it to knows exactly which of the millions of cells on the spreadsheet you are giving them vs just some boring rando cell. In this special cell, it is even possible to put a hyperlink to whatever you want on the internet, you don't even have to have any ownership of the linked content. Maybe you want to put a link to an ugly computer generated monkey, and want to tell people if they put your username is a bunch of the generic spreadsheet cells, you will put their username is this one special cell with the hyperlink. Good job, you just sold and NFT.",1643678496.0,39

That is proof of work blockchains basically, afaik.

With such a set up, anyone can see if any fraudelant action is done within the database. Blockchain or crypto in no way makes a difference to this.

What blockchain does, is it removes the central authority, so even if somone publicly did want to change the database against the agreed rules, they cant.

(actually that can still happen. the current ethereum is a forked version of the original, ethereum classic. but the rules were changed, because the most powerful people didng like what happened) 

However, this is no way secures anything else than a transaction of a currency.

Think about it like this. I make new crypto with 10 coins. I buy all ten for $10. The new market cap is $10 and coin is $1/coin. I sell one coin to my friend for $2. Market cap is up ""100%"" on the volume of $2. My friend sells it for $30/coin. Now the market cap is $30/coin \* 10 = $300 total but the 24-hour change is up from $1->$30 -> 2900%

You want a guide? Check the collections on opensea with the most volume. Join their discord, build yourself a network of people into nfts on twitter. Grind whitelists, get into the game. I personnaly don't know a single person who lost money in nfts as of today. People really underestimate the amount of capital in the nft market.

I think the key thing that separates litecoin from the pack is that it has existing infrastructure that has had 100 percent uptime and a growing userbase. The other coins you have mentioned do not have all this.

What makes litecoin even more interesting is that it has all the features of top 200 coins rolled into one. Will this make it stand out from the pack? Time will tell but people often forget that users and infrastructure are king in this space.

""Capitol Police officers were instructed by leaders not to use their most aggressive tactics when responding to the mob of pro-Trump rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, according to a new report from the agency’s internal watchdog.   
  
In the report, titled “Review of the Events Surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, Takeover of the U.S. Capitol,” which was obtained by The New York Times, Capitol Police Inspector General Michael Bolton found that three days before the mob attack, officials were warned in an intelligence assessment of the potential for violence on Jan. 6 in which “Congress itself is the target.”   
  
“Stop the Steal’s propensity to attract white supremacists, militia members, and others who actively promote violence may lead to a significantly dangerous situation for law enforcement and the general public alike,” the assessment added, Bolton noted in his report.   
  
Despite this warning, Bolton said that the agency wrote in a plan for the responses to the Jan. 6 pro-Trump rallies that there were “no specific known threats related to the joint session of Congress” as it met to certify President Biden’s electoral win.   
  
In the 104-page document, which has not yet been widely released to the public, Bolton reportedly added that the Capitol Police’s Civil Disturbance Unit, which is specifically responsible for handling large protests, was ordered by supervisors not to use the department’s most powerful tools and techniques, according to the Times.""",1643662490.0,-1

You mean illegal. You can do something illegal without doing something corrupt. Important difference. And yes, in the pure legal sense something that isn’t outlawed breaks fewer rules - why have laws at all? As you can figure out, that doesn’t solve the problem connected to it - it’s not the law that makes rape a problem for example.  


Market regulation is aimed at making markets fairer for all participants. If you simply don’t create a rule that a hedge fund can intercept your order flow, see if it’s advantageous for the fund to load off some of their positions such that they have a constant advantage against you, that doesn’t make that less of a problem. Of course, just adding more and more rules on topic will lead to marginal returns. Plus as the legislation you’re almost always a step behind and the reflex of just adding regulation on top is not really helpful. But the crypto space is currently almost unregulated- nearly everything goes in comparison to classical markets. Wash trading, pump and dump, all the things that an investor with a lot more sophistication than you can do to take you out unfairly are possible and common in the crypto space. Plus now classical high finance dominates crypto, hedge funds, trading firms, banks, all the guys that will take every last penny from you with all means possible. They know the game and if they essentially have a pre-Glass-Steagall market with high capital on which they can just and sell all the shitty convoluted instruments, market them to you shamelessly, bringing other participants of your economy to back their real goods with their Ponzi system which is just rugpulled at one point and giving you a loss even if you didn’t even participate in said market. 


Many things you can do in classical finance you could do in defi as well. If you want to keep this system developing, you gotta make sure there is no regulatory arbitrage. There must be regulation.

5058,CryptoCurrency,President Biden to Regulate Bitcoin and the DeFi Sector.,Cup-Confident,1643654953.0,407,291,0.78,"""Forcing agencies to review/propose regulations""... Multiple governmental agencies have been voluntarily doing this to crypto for the last 7+ years (see everyone's favorite groups: IRS & SEC, as well as others like OCC and CFTC). And this is exactly why things are so confusing in the space.

The entire point of this executive order is to get all the different agencies with their haphazard approaches and cobbled together rules to agree on a standardization and use it moving forward - which will most likely be written by said agencies.

There's no deep state, overreaching power-grab by telling the agencies that are meant to regulate the financial ecosystem...to regulate the financial ecosystem with more clarity. Once things are hammered out the groups can submit to Congress if it needs to be written into code, or Congress can take that mantle up themselves by evoking a measure in the CRA if they think the proposals overstep.

Additionally, EOs can be struck down by the Supreme Court, lower courts, and Congress in multiple ways. And they've been used since the inception of the constitution.

I don't have a narrative to push besides correcting misinformation. You're getting upset at an executive order that is, in essence, asking for a research paper to be written in the next 6 months. There's almost no other information available to the public at the moment besides the White House ""weighing in on various topics"" - not anything close to writing laws.",1643677326.0,0

Prior to the recent crash, last I checked almost 30% of coins had a positive return (if you account for survivorship bias) which, although fucking horrible, isn't the 1% he pulled from his ass.

Also important to note the vast majority of returns in the crypto market mid term (there is no long term data, crypto is too new) is driven by a few massive outliers. Most coins with postive returns fail to beat basic conservative market indexes while a few (2-4%, but I'm not 100% sure on that number) have ridiculous 100x+ returns.

5325,algotrading,Quantitative Hedge Fund career path,TheBomb999,1643692728.0,6,0,0.5,">I was wondering if this is a risky career choice

Yes. 100% yes.

It's risky as fuck, there aren't many firms hiring and even those who are hiring don't have a huge number of open positions (and you're competing with applicants from all over the world). The interview process is also usually brutal, and even if you get the job, the turnover is higher than most industries.

I don't say this to discourage you, I made this choice and it paid off (I got the job I wanted as a quant), but I'm completely aware that I got lucky. Yes, I put in the work, I studied a lot, I practiced interview questions, etc... but many people do the same thing and still get their resume thrown in the bin. Obviously, you can (and should) play the odds by applying to all positions you see, but there is always the possibility that you get unlucky every time.

The risk is definitely there. I had several fallback plans in place (that I could definitely still need, if I can't keep this job) like operations, compliance, audit, back-office quant stuff, software dev, data science... I simply thought of it as a high risk - high reward type of thing.

Thankfully, the education path to become a quant allows you to apply for most/all of those fallback roles too. So in that sense, the education path itself isn't really high risk.

>Also, how much do those guys get paid on average?

Who knows. There's too much variability to get a reliable average, because salaries are driven by the variable bonus, not the fixed base. Total compensation will vary by year and by trader, so I have never been able to find an average by asking around.

What I do know first hand is that internships pay way more than they should, and new full time hires at most shops should get around 200k in their first year (and they're expected to earn more after that, as the bonus is theoretically uncapped).",1643698622.0,2

Then I run that set of stocks against my strategy. 

The way my strategy is set up, I perform a Johansen test each day based on a specified look back period to determine the vectors (trace or eigenvalue) or allocations of the stocks if I enter a trade. When doing this I find a very short half life of a day or two vs. the expected half-life of say 20 days based on the initial selection process I performed to find the cointegrated set of equities. I think this is due to the fact that I am resetting the mean every day and therefore never let the z Score get to high or low. Needless to say I don’t find this reliable as it contradicts the initial assumption of cointegration. 

My question is, has anyone successfully performed a mean reversion on more than two securities using Johnson test and if so what method did they use and how frequently did they reset the vectors to determine proper allocation of securities.",1643681713.0,1

Other than that:

Annual return is \~10%. The numbers has IB's commission factored in, but not counting dividend.

Here they profit from the mispriced trade.

These spikes occur when the first algorithm turns off. Since the offer behind is algorithm 2, quoting a much wider price (higher ask, lower bid), you see a spiking jump in ask. Why does algorithm 1 turn off? Many defensive reasons, e.g. the market maker expects a sudden jump in prices (around market numbers), or the market is very busy and they don't want to be picked off on their tight prices.

This is a Nasdaq100 ETF trading on some European exchange with almost no volume. It's called ANX. It often goes a whole hourly bar without a single trade. I was speculating that maybe MMs clear their orders just before market close to avoid gap risk. This would explain why the price more often gaps to exactly the same level because it jumps to some constant order that is far removed from the actual price and not placed by MMs. But that would imply almost the entire order book is just MMs constantly.",1643492201.0,7

I think that is a great explanation for what we are seeing! And you would be likely correct that it is just MM activity, I'm sure a large percentage of any given security has market-making of some sort. And why not? Arbitrage makes money as long as the price is moving. The downside of arbitrage is the hedged shares that are withheld. Ideally price goes up and you unload for profit, but you must more aggressively pare down withohldings on a downturn or face asset risk. And you can best hedge against that for clearing as many out as possible and converting to cash! Basically you wouldn't want to have so many chips on hand, better to cash out and buy the dip back.

I still think my explanation has some merit. I've never actually had premarket tapes before to look for anomalies, I've only had access to heartbeat quotes for detailed spreads. I assumed that gaps form generally before markets come online, at least the most significant ones. I have seen some serious gaps just before market though. In such a case the price action is very volatile! This can even happen suddenly seconds before open.",1643495975.0,2

1. They are a business. Any business has to make profit.

2. The business mentality is often reflected in the comments and reviews people leave. Try to read the rational ones. Many people make emotional reviews after being disillusioned by the outcome... But this can happen with anything even legit stuff. 

3. I had a client do a algo trading thing on the side. To get in she had to put down a minimum of 300-500. Next they would keep her up to date on her gains. The deal was, the more money she put down the more often they would trade with her money. 
So in her case it was only once per week. 

4. The problems started when she wanted to cash in and remove her money. It took for ever and ages before it ever happened. They had many reasons why it got delayed. 

5. Bottom line and my advice. Algo Trading doesn't have to be unlegit. But like everything trading it involves risks that you agree to by handing them your money.  
If you are looking for a fast way to make money. I highly suggest you reconsider your stand on a investing and consider investing your money in a legit course on investment. 
If you have done your do diligence and research on the company and you still want to invest your money with them then that's also fine.

Tight stops can usually handle a wider price target ratio (ie: 3:1 with a $10 stop has an equivalent price target as 6:1 with a $5 stop), which means a win can offset more losses. There is also the notion that the best trades (ie: those with the most momentum) typically start working right away. Giving a trade room to breathe so it can come back against you can still result in a winning trade, but such a scenario has a lower probability than a trade that moves quickly in your favor. Lastly, tighter stops result in quicker trades, which means more potential trades. If you have a decent positive expectancy, then more trades means more compounding of your account.

It's like comparing the old practice of prescribing willow bark tea (not medicine, but had a reason why it worked) versus surgery without sterilized instruments, antibiotics, or anaesthesia (early medicine that was scientific but not necessarily more successful until it improved a lot over time).

However the actual mechanisms of quantitative analysis have very little to do with the specific practices of TA. It isn't about being more tidy in how you backtest an MA crossover strategy. It's about doing things in some mix of linear and nonlinear statistical analysis to create processes that the quant understands very clearly what they do and why and with what limitations (yes, I'm handwaving when neural net optimization strategies are added... even science will glue things together with chicken entrails in a pinch).

A quant will do very rigorous work, but they have to make sure it ends up relevant and not busywork mathematics (enter the world of econometrics, for example).  TA practicioners are more often doing something relevant in a way that is usually obvious... whether it turns out to be rigorous enough to repeatably depend upon is the tougher call.

I find TA is more accurate on shorter term timeframes.  I have a better probability of guessing what's going to happen in the next few minutes versus what might happen tomorrow, next week, next month or year.  Just like I can better predict that it wont rain in the next 15 minutes versus next week.

What many fail to understand is that TA is imperfect.  It's more of an art and less of a science, though obviously there's a scientific component.  The art is finding the right combination, timing, external correlations, etc. This would be your edge.

Further, position and account management is required to keep you from going broke when TA doesn't work.  Many of the times, the market is more predictable (say 80%), and other times (20%) it's utter chaos and impossible to guess because of factors beyond the charts.  This could be macro events, news, tweets, etc.  Things that are impossible to anticipate.

Some would look for a simple MA crossover or use an indicator, optimize for a particular dataset, backtest it with some success and think they're going to be rich.  Then they try to live trade it and find very different results.  This happens on this sub almost everyday and leads many to believe TA doesn't work.

If TA doesn't work, then day trading is impossible.  I know of plenty of successful day traders, so my opinion is that TA works, but is not easy.

I can’t stand to watch that guy long enough to judge him as a person, so we can assume he’s a pretty good guy, with 50% certainty. Now let’s come up with a prior for whether he’s full of crap. Let’s count top investment strategists who are employed by someone else and that 3rd party is totes cool with them spending a lot of time YouTubing when they could be working AND giving potentially 9 billion people advice on how to compete with the employer. I know of none or him I guess, so let’s put a one there. And let’s count people who are full of shit on the internet...ok it’s a lot...the tally is something like 3 billion. 3 billion plus one goes in the denominator and coding Jesus goes up top and the probability he is talented AND trying to help you figure stuff out is then a pretty small number.

But to your question, algorithmic trading can involve pairs of assets cointegrating and portfolio optimizations that really have nothing to do with TA. But surprise, surprise if you use TA and apply statistics correctly you can know whether whatever you’re doing actually may work. People don’t do that as much as they should, so your distinction is kind of on point, but not trivial. Peoples opinions about this get shared pretty repetitively here without any data to show how they arrived at them. I think many, myself included, discount TA out of a bias towards more academic methods. I’ve tried like 5-6 in various combinations and found that only one seemed to not make the model I was building worse. It was a stochastic oscillator of some kind. I’ve since found much better ways to incorporate the conceptual advantages of an oscillator without using a TA formula. Much more computationally difficult, but actually simpler and simply right more. The problem is people want progress now and we feel like if we just collect a lot of easy to acquire data we can make it work later. Nope. From big ventures to small, that does not work. It is a mythology. People who know what they are doing design stuff that most people think is wildly successful because of some godlike data warehouse. Unsurprisingly, psychologists design addictive apps. Mathematicians, scientists, and phds create successful hedge funds. In both cases there is data, and more than is needed, but the successful ventures are ones where an experiment is set up to test a hypothesis and not one where the data is selected from infinitely many sets until the right hypothesis and experiment are found.",1643351933.0,7

But none of this stuff looks like RSI's and the other junk retail traders obsess over.   arXiv has a quantitative finance section.  When you read the studies there you'll find that it's nothing even remotely close to the indicator soup retail traders use. 

The approach you describe in the post doesn't really work because of fat tails.  Data points on the tails are by their nature more rare, but can completely dominate the profitability of the system.  Since they are more rare you need more data to see them.  You'll need orders of magnitude more data than you'll get from two years of daily data to confirm it works.

You can actually describe any “technical analysis” using raw data and then validate a technical analysis’s hypothesis by looking at price/volume and other data and seeing how often the same input pattern leads to output. 

Basically, “technical analysis” is a tiny subset of information that data and statistics can already capture. As you noted it’s most bs because you can’t really validate your hypotheses well. On the other hand you can search through data for how often some statistical pattern occurred and then use that try and predict the future.

Using the spread is the most trivial form of this arbitrage strategy as the numbers are right there in the open, and probably works fairly well for illiquid assets, especially for those with no market maker.

You can use theoretical pricing models to find minimum and maximum values of the option, then have your algorithm adjust the bid (your min theo value) and ask (max value) for the contract you’re quoting. As time changes, underlying price, all other variables for your pricing model etc you’ll update your quotes accordingly. It’s a bit easier to quote options vs underlying (for me) because you have a theoretical value you’re quoting that gives you some theoretical edge.

Generally speaking you’re looking at coin flips that are slightly weighted. You either need a lot of coin flips to believe in your system, or you need a few coin flips that you’re VERY confident on.

1. I trade like >20 strategies. None of them requires more than 4 English sentences to explain. You can make very complicated strategies, but it is just not required.
2. Simple strategy means that it is NOT easy to overfit. (It can still happen)
3. RSI works. TA works. Price action works. Fundamental works. News also work. They can be used to build profitable strategies when used individually or combined. People saying otherwise is either not digging deep enough or looking into the wrong direction.
4. Win rates mean nothing on its own.... theoretically. Although practically >60% is a good thing to have because it gives you more room for errors. Extremely high win rate usually occurs when you heavily filter your signals. But then you need to trade MANY strategies to keep your account busy (idle cash is not good).

I'm not sure what business ties you need, they have experienced developers, built the contract, migrated everyone over smoothly and are working on an app already.
